That\'s not where I got the idea to share this amazing Moroccan harira, but if I did a list called, ""The Best Soups You\'re Not Eating,"" this would be at the top.', ""I added some cubed up lamb shoulder to mine, which works wonderfully well with the other flavors here, but the combination of the lentils and chickpeas, along with the starchy goodness of the pasta makes for a very hearty, satisfying soup, whether you use meat or not. Besides going full plant-based, I've heard beef or chicken are also great choices, so as usual, feel free to play around with the ingredient list."", ""Sadly, I've never been to Morocco, but I'm told this is the national soup, and once you taste it, it's not hard to understand why. Like all great soups, this warms the body, and comforts the soul, but there's something else happening I can't quite put my finger on. Maybe it's the silkiness from the slurry, or the warming, aromatic spices, but whatever is going on produces a truly unique soup that simply can't be missed, and I really do hope you give it a try soon. Enjoy!"", 'Heat olive oil in a stock pot over medium-high heat and cook cubed lamb until nicely browned and some of the fat has rendered, about 5 minutes.', 'Toss in diced onion and a generous pinch of salt.

The villagers, wary of the traveler and suspicious of his sudden appearance, refused to give him any food.', 'The man, unfazed by this display of stinginess, smiled politely at the unfriendly villagers before setting up camp near a local stream. Once he was situated, he wordlessly filled his pot with water, placed it over a fire, then dropped a stone into his makeshift ""soup.""', 'Village members couldn\'t help but ask the traveler what he was creating over the fire. ""I\'m making stone soup,"" he replied. ""It\'s delicious. I\'ll be glad to share it with all of you when I\'m finished — I just need to find a few more ingredients."" One by one, the villagers added ingredients from their individual homes, making a rich vegetable soup worth sharing.', 'Of course, the story exists to teach a lesson: Sharing, a necessary part of life, makes everything better. However, a dish called ""stone soup"" that uses the elements really does exist in Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'The Chinantec people used the rocky Mexican terrain to their advantage during the Pre-Ceramic period, according to Culinary Backstreets.

The bread is then served warm either with a topping spooned over or with a topping on the side so each person can build their own bruschetta.

Rub on a little more garlic for a stronger flavor, if you wish. But watch out: A little garlic goes a long way.· Be patient: Make the tomato mixture and let it sit for a couple of hours so the flavors can develop more complexity. Yes, the tomatoes may give off a lot of juice as they marinate, but if you think the mixture is too juicy come serving time, simply use a slotted spoon to lift out the bruschetta topping as you spoon it over the bread. Don't toss the liquid, though — lots of people love to dip into it with extra bread.

Well, here's how you can easily combine the healthful eating guidelines of the Mediterranean diet with the time-saving convenience of a multi-cooker. To get you started, I'll share a quick overview of the Mediterranean diet plus easy recipes you can make in your Instant Pot or pressure cooker."", ""What is the Mediterranean diet? This popular healthy eating plan emphasizes whole foods, fresh vegetables and fruits, whole grains, healthy fats such as olive oil and avocado, and proteins such as chicken, seafood, nuts, beans, and legumes. In addition, you'll cut back on added sugars and processed foods, and eat dairy in moderation. You'll also cut back on added salt by using fresh and dried herbs to flavor your food instead."", ""What are the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet? According to the Mayo Clinic, following this eating style can result in a longer life expectancy and lower rates of chronic diseases. In fact, it's been consistently ranked among the best diets overall."", 'Do I have to eat only Mediterranean food on the Mediterranean diet? Not at all. There are many international cuisines that happen to fall within the guidelines, including Asian and Mexican food. Just be sure you make healthy ingredient choices, such as chicken or seafood instead of pork or red meat, olive oil instead of coconut oil or lard, low-sodium broths, and more herbs instead of added salt.', '""I\'ve made this recipe twice in the last month and we just love it! The Instant Pot makes it so easy.

And who can take the credit?', ""A likely case comes from Dallas oil executive Everette Lee DeGolyer, a chili connoisseur who became a historian in his later years. DeGolyer's findings suggest that chili became popular campfire fare among cowboys on the cattle trail (most of whom were Mexican) and gold-seekers (called forty-niners) on their way to California. As evidence, DeGolyer points to a journal from a forty-niner, dated from 1849 to 1850:"", 'In short, beef, fat, chile peppers, and seasoning were combined into blocks, dubbed ""chili bricks,"" which were stored in saddlebags. Plunging part of a chili block into a pot of boiling water transformed it into a convenient, filling meal.', ""Others suggest that a group of women first concocted the dish: the lavanderas (washerwomen) who traveled through Texas with the Mexican Army in the 1830s and '40s, washing clothes and cooking for the soldiers. It's said their large washing pots doubled as cooking pots to stew venison or goat with chile peppers."", ""Another theory credits a small population of immigrants from the Canary Islands, then a territory of Spain, who Spanish colonists brought to San Antonio in 1731 to counter France from spreading its territory west of Louisiana. Chili resembles Canarian cooking in its use of dried cumin, and it's said Canarian women in Texas were known for cooking a spicy stew."", ""Regardless of how chili first came to be, one group popularized it as a San Antonio staple. Mexican women known as the Chili Queens cooked and sold chili at San Antonio's Military Plaza as early as the 1860s, Texas historian Robb Walsh says. Soldiers, travelers, cattlemen, and others congregated at the plaza for the dish, the granddaughter of one of the last Chili Queens told NPR. Customers often ordered chili with tamales or with beans and a tortilla."", 'Outdoor chili stands remained fixtures of San Antonio through the 1930s, when the local government began shutting them down, citing sanitary reasons. The last chili stands closed in the early 1940s.', ""A San Antonio chili stand at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair introduced many to the Texas-born dish. Soon, chili parlors began cropping up all over the Midwest and elsewhere in the United States. For example, the first written mention of chili in Oklahoma dates to 1897, and recipes for the dish appeared in community cookbooks in 1903 and 1905, according to the Oklahoma Historical Society."", 'Over the following decades, regional variations of chili developed. In 1922, Macedonian immigrants opened Empress Chili in Cincinnati. They drew inspiration from the chili parlors Americans were familiar with to sell a Mediterranean-style stew over spaghetti. Empress Chili put Cincinnati on the map as another chili destination.', ""Other Midwestern takes include Indiana's Hoosier Chili, Oklahoma Chili, Illinois's Springfield Chili, and Missouri's Kansas City Chili."", 'Unlike ""Texas red"" chili, New Mexico\'s version uses the Hatch chile, grown in the town of Hatch, and gets the name chile verde (green chili) from this key ingredient. Though chili and chile verde share similarities, the dishes developed apart from each other. Chile verde hails from northern Mexico, and it consists of pork chunks, green chilis, onions, and tomatillos.', 'The International Chili Society, which holds the World Championship Chili Cook-off, divides chili into the following categories: traditional red, chili verde, homestyle chili, and veggie chili.', ""As purists would have it, traditional red (chili con carne) hasn't changed much over the years. It still consists of meat, red chili peppers, and spices—no beans, rice, pasta, or other fillers, aside from vegetables, according to ICS criteria.""]"

Here are some of the key ingredients you'll find in the Chinese kitchen."", ""Soy sauce: An incredibly versatile ingredient in Chinese cooking, soy sauce is used to flavor sauces, stews, marinades and meat, fish and vegetable dishes. Chinese soy sauce is generally saltier and not as sweet as Japanese. Try it in General Tsao's Chicken II."", 'Plum sauce: A traditional sauce for duck and pork recipes, plum sauce is a thick, sweet-and-sour sauce. It is made with plums, apricots and seasonings and sometimes goes by the name ""duck sauce."" Make your own Plum Sauce. And try it with Peking Duck.', 'Black bean sauce: A sauce made from fermented soybeans, ginger and orange peel. Try it in Chicken with Green Peppers in Black Bean Sauce.', ""Hoisin sauce: Sweet and spicy, hoisin sauce is primarily a table condiment made with soybeans (or wheat), garlic, chile pepper, and other spices. It is almost jam-like in consistency and is frequently used to flavor meat, poultry and seafood dishes. Try it in Chinese Barbeque Pork (Char Siu) or On Luck's Hoisin Pepper Steak Stir-Fry."", 'Peanut oil: A flavorful oil with a high smoking point excellent for stir-frying. Chinese peanut oil has a pronounced peanut flavor often missing in American versions. Try it in Hong Kong Sweet and Sour Pork.', 'Sesame oil: Dark and flavorful, sesame oil accentuates many Chinese dishes and is meant to be used sparingly. Store sesame oil in a cool, dry place. Try it with Chinese Pork Dumplings.', ""Rice wine: Somewhat sweet and low in alcohol, rice wine is made from fermenting steamed glutinous rice. Try it in Lion's Head Meatballs."", 'Chinese red and black vinegars: If you cannot find these vinegars, try substituting balsamic vinegar. Try Chinese black vinegar in Sichuan Cucumber Salad or Taiwanese Fried Tofu.', 'Chili paste: An important ingredient in Chinese cooking, chili paste is made from fermented fava beans, red chiles, flour, and garlic. Try it in Spicy Crispy Beef or Chongqing Chicken.', 'Five-spice powder: A pungent mix of Szechuan peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, fennel seed, and star anise, five-spice powder is used extensively in Chinese cooking. It is not always limited to just five ingredients, however. Try it in Grilled Five Spice Chicken.', ""Sesame seeds: Mild and nut-like, sesame seeds are used to add texture and flavor to a variety of Chinese dishes. Their flavor intensifies when toasted. Try it with Beef and Riced Broccoli Bowl or Chef John's Shrimp Toast."", 'Ginger: Spicy, pungent, peppery and somewhat sweet, fresh ginger adds big flavor to Chinese dishes, whether grated, ground, slivered or minced. Try it in Steamed Fish with Ginger.', 'Pork: The most important meat in Chinese cooking, pork is highly versatile, found in everything from dumplings to soups, stir-fries to spare ribs. Try these Chinese Pork Recipes.', 'Tofu: A versatile ingredient, tofu is enjoyed in stir-fries, soups, casseroles, salads, sauces, and sandwiches. It is high in protein and an excellent meat substitute. Tofu is made by pressing curdled soy milk in a process similar to cheese making. Smooth and creamy, the firmness of tofu varies. Tofu is perishable and should be refrigerated and eaten within a week of purchase. Try it in Vegan Mapo Tofu.', 'Rice: One of the most important ingredients in Chinese cuisine, particularly in the south, rice is indigenous to China and has been cultivated there for thousands of years. Many kinds of rice are used in Chinese cooking of various sizes, shapes, and colors. Rice goes with so many Chinese Main Dishes.', 'Wonton or spring roll wrappers: Look for these paper-thin sheets prepackaged in many supermarkets. Try it in Pork Dumplings.', 'Straw mushrooms: Grown on straw, these tiny mushrooms are earthy and musty. They are usually available in the United States in cans, though they can be found fresh in some specialty stores. Try it in Moo Goo Gai Pan.', 'Bean sprouts: The sprouts that spring forth from mung beans are the most popular in Chinese cooking, adding a crisp, earthy element to many dishes. They are quite perishable and should be stored refrigerated in a plastic bag or covered in water in the refrigerator. Best eaten raw, bean sprouts also do well in stir-fries after very brief cooking. Try them with Egg Foo Yung with Mushroom Sauce or Chicken Jook with Lots of Vegetables.', 'Shallots: Part of the onion family, shallots look more like garlic. Milder than an onion, shallots are used like onions in Chinese cooking. Dry shallots will keep in a cool, dry place for about a month. Try them in Chinese Steamed Buns with BBQ Pork Filling.', ""Bok choy: Actually a very small cabbage, bok choy's leaves are tender and mild; its stalk is crunchy. Boy choy is used in soups, salads, stir-fries, and cooked vegetables.

Try it in Chef John's Chinese Scallion Pancakes."", 'Red chiles: The Portuguese brought chile peppers to China following the age of exploration in the Americas. Today, they are an indispensable ingredient in spicy Szechuan cuisine. Try it in Quick Szechwan Sauce or Hunan Kung Pao.', ""Garlic: A member of the lily family (along with leeks, chives, onions and shallots), garlic is the strongest-flavored, most assertive member of the group. Look for firm dry heads of garlic. Store them whole and unbroken in a cool, dry, dark location. They'll stay for about two months. To peel garlic, place the clove under the flat side of a chef's knife and gently press down with the ball of your hand, lightly crushing the clove. The skin will split, allowing you to pull it off the clove more easily. Try it in Chinese Take-Out Shrimp with Garlic."", 'Cilantro: A member of the parsley family (also known as Chinese parsley), cilantro has a distinctive green, waxy flavor. Cilantro is the usual name for the leaf of the plant otherwise known as coriander, and from which coriander seed is obtained. Try it in Fried Rice with Cilantro.', 'Cabbages: There are many kinds of cabbage sold in Chinese markets. One of the more familiar in the United States is the Napa cabbage, a light-flavored vegetable with very pale green leaves. A very popular addition to stir-fries. Try it in Black Pepper Beef and Cabbage Stir Fry.', 'Check out our collection of Chinese Recipes.']"

As foreigners took away spices, they also contributed to India's cuisine. The Chinese brought rice and the wok; the Portuguese introduced vinegar, tomatoes, potatoes, and chilies. Persian, Mongolian and Indonesian influences were also significant. Here are key ingredients to stock in your pantry for delicious DIY Indian recipes."", 'Cardamom: An important spice in garam masala, cardamom has a grapefruit-like, floral, soapy flavor containing some green/woody notes. It has a menthol undertone and is similar to ginger. It is used as whole pods, as seeds, and ground. Try it in Easy Vegetarian Kofta Curry.', 'Cinnamon: Cinnamon is characteristically woody, musty and earthy in flavor and aroma and is warming to taste. The finer the grind, the more quickly the cinnamon is perceived by the taste buds. Whole cinnamon sticks are often infused in sauces and rice. Unlike in the West, where cinnamon is associated with sweet baked goods, in India it is a savory spice that is also used in meat dishes. Try it in Curry Stand Chicken Tikka Masala Sauce.', 'Cilantro/Coriander: The flavor and aroma of cilantro (fresh coriander) is generally described as being waxy, citrus, and soapy. The flavor of the leaf is distinctive, and quite different from that of the coriander seed. Cilantro is used as a garnish, in seasoning blends, and in sauces such as masala and curry. Ground coriander is an important ingredient in curry powders and garam masala. Its flavor is described as being minty, sweet and citrus-like.', 'Cloves: The flavor of cloves is strong, pungent, sweet--almost hot. They are one of the most penetrating of all spices and their bitter, astringent flavor leaves a numbing sensation in the mouth. Cloves are an important ingredient in the spice blends of Sri Lanka and North India. They are used in garam masala, biryanis, and pickles.', 'Cumin: An important ingredient in garam masala and curry powder, cumin is characterized by a strong musty, earthy flavor which also contains some green/grassy notes. Both whole seeds and ground cumin are used in cooking. Try it in Indian Butter Chicken (Chicken Makhani).', 'Listen to Allrecipes ""Homemade"" podcast to hear Aarti Sequeria\'s essential Indian spices and more!', 'Fenugreek: Rich and round with a slight bite, this aromatic plant is known for its pleasantly bitter, slightly sweet seeds. Fenugreek seeds, which come whole and ground, are used to flavor many foods, including curry powders, spice blends and teas. Fenugreek seeds should be stored in a cool, dark place for no more than 6 months. Try it in Dal Makhani (Indian Lentils).', 'Garam masala: Garam is the Hindi word for ""warm"" or ""hot,"" and this blend of dry-roasted ground spices from the colder climes of northern India adds a sense of warmth to both palate and spirit. There are as many variations of garam masala (which may contain up to 12 spices) as there are Indian cooks. It can include black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, cumin, cardamom, dried chiles, fennel, ginger, mace and nutmeg. Garam masala is usually either added to a curries, vegetable dishes, soups, or stews toward the end of cooking or sprinkled over the surface just before serving. Check out 10 Amazing Indian Recipes to Make with Garam Masala.', 'Mint: Often paired with lamb dishes and served in raitas and chutneys, this cooling herb has a pleasantly fresh, aromatic, sweet flavor. Try it in Indian Style Sheekh Kabab.', 'Tamarind: Also called Indian date, concentrated tamarind pulp is used to add a somewhat sour flavor to chutneys and curries. Limes are an acceptable substitute. Try it in Lamb Shank Vindaloo.', 'Turmeric: This ground dried root has a characteristic musky, earthy aroma and a pungent, slightly bitter flavor. Turmeric is a powerful yellow-orange coloring agent, used as a dye for fabrics and foods such as pickles, relish, and chutneys, plus rice, lentil, and vegetable dishes. Turmeric is thought to aid the digestion and to work as an anti-inflammatory agent. Try it in Super Easy Oven-Roasted Okra.', 'Additional spices: Indian food is so rich with spices that what we have above is only a partial list. For a well-stocked pantry, you might consider stocking up on peppercorns (the source of ""heat"" in spicy foods before the introduction of chiles), fennel seeds, poppy seeds, bay leaves, black mustard seeds, nigella seeds (kalonji--sometimes called black onion seed), saffron, and asafoetida.', 'Chiles: Indigenous to America, chiles were introduced into India by the Portuguese. They are essential ingredients in making vindaloo curries (itself a perversion of a Portuguese word vindalho, which combines the words ""vinho,"" for vinegar, and ""aldos,"" for garlic.) Indian cuisine makes use of both fresh chiles (whole, minced, or made into a paste) and dried chiles. If a recipe calls for chile powder, use ground cayenne pepper — do not use a spice blend. Try cayenne in Jonagold\'s Chicken Vindaloo.', 'Coconuts: The milk and oil from coconuts are important particularly in Southern Indian cooking where it is popular in curries. Grated coconut is often used in desserts or added to sauces. Try coconut milk in Mango Coconut Sauce.', 'Tomatoes: As with chiles, tomatoes were brought to India by the seafaring Portuguese. They are an important component in curries, vegetable dishes, and chutneys. Try crushed whole tomatoes in Indian Tomato Chicken.', 'Garlic: Garlic, ginger, and green chiles are an important flavor trilogy in Indian cuisine, sautéed in oil or ghee as a first step in many recipes. Try garlic (along with ginger and green chiles) in Spicy Indian Chicken with Green Masala.', 'Ginger: The edible part of the ""ginger root"" is actually part of the underground portion of the plant\'s stem, not the root. Often used in paste form, ginger adds strong fragrance, flavor, and bite to curries and other dishes. Try minced fresh ginger in Potatoes with Fresh Ginger and Chilies.', ""Mangos: One of India's most important fruits, mangoes come in dozens of varieties. They're eaten fresh and used in drinks, chutneys, and pickles. Try sliced mango in Indian Hot Curried Mangos with Tofu."", ""Fresh Vegetables: Indian cooks have created one of the world's most vegetable-friendly cuisines. If you're interested in eating more vegetarian foods, Indian cuisine is a great place to start. Among the most popular vegetables are potatoes, spinach, cauliflower, onions, peas, and eggplant. Check out our collection of Vegetarian Indian Main Dishes."", 'Basmati rice: The name means ""queen of fragrance."" This long-grained, fine-textured rice has been grown in the foothills of the Himalayas for centuries. The rice is used in biryanis and other special-occasion rice dishes. Try this recipe for Indian Style Basmati Rice.', 'Lentils: Because many Indian religious practices limit or forbid the eating of meat, Indian cuisine abounds with lentil dishes (a fine source of protein), including stuffed samosas, soups, stews, and breads. Lentils are ""pulses,"" and they come in many eye-catching colors. Hulled red lentils are common; they are smaller and faster-cooking than brown lentils — for best flavor, do not substitute brown lentils.', 'Garbanzo beans: Also called chickpeas, garbanzo beans are available canned, dried and sometimes fresh. Dried garbanzo beans are also ground into flour. Try canned chickpeas in Indian Kale with Chickpeas. and dried chickpeas in Crunchy Spiced Chickpeas.', 'Flour: Breads can be eaten in place of rice in many parts of India: grilled breads such as naan, griddled breads such as chapati and roti, and the crepe-like dosa. Fried breads such as samosas, pappadam, and paratha are served as appetizers and snacks and as desserts. Check out our collection of Indian Breads.', 'Dairy products are relatively rare in Indian cuisine, due to their short shelf-life in the warm climate and a historical lack of refrigeration. By processing dairy foods (culturing yogurt, clarifying butter, cooking milk to make sweets), Indian cooks made them more available.', 'Yogurt: Yogurt is often spiced and served as a condiment (raitas), used in place of coconut milk in curries, or prepared as a sweet or salty beverage (lassi).', 'Paneer: Indian cuisine is not big on cheese. But paneer is a notable exception. A non-melting fresh cheese, paneer is similar to queso blanco (a good substitute) or fresh mozzarella. Paneer is a vegetarian cheese, meaning that there is no rennet added. Make your own Homemade Paneer and try it in Palak Paneer Curry.', 'Ghee: A type of clarified butter that is particularly popular in Northern Indian cuisine, ghee has a brown color and rich, nutty flavor. Butter is simmered until all the moisture separates from the fat and the milk solids sink to the bottom of the pan, so they can be skimmed off. Ghee has benefits over whole butter in that it has a significantly higher smoke point and a longer shelf life. See Clarifying Butter for step-by-step instructions.', 'Check out our complete collection of Indian Recipes.', '']"

Not too thick or coarse, panko crumbs are flaky, light, and airy, so they create a delicate but crispy coating on just about anything that needs a little crunch — from chicken tenders to breaded veggies and baked casseroles. You can also use panko in place of breadcrumbs to help bind meatballs, tuna or rice cakes, meatloaves, and veggie burgers. Here are some favorite recipes that showcase ways to put your panko to delicious use.', 'Let\'s start with a classic. Tonkatsu is the traditional Japanese boneless, breaded pork chop. ""A wonderful, easy recipe, yet special,"" says Trish. ""I love another use for panko crumbs.""', 'Crispy outside, moist and tender inside with a surprise garlic-butter center, this elegant chicken recipe can\'t fail to impress.

It was a great easy recipe full of flavor! I sprinkled a little Parmesan cheese on top. Yum!""', 'Panko crumbs also make the best Scotch eggs. ""In my version of Scotch eggs, I keep the egg soft, so when you bite in, you get that amazing contrast in texture between the molten yolk and the crispy sausage shell,"" says Chef John.', ""Panko makes a great topping for almost any casserole that you'd top with breadcrumbs or potato chips. Here's a semi-fancy, adult-friendly mac-and-cheese that proves the point."", '""I love Asian-style fish or shrimp cakes but almost never order them because I find there\'s too much filler or \'binder,\'"" says Chef John.

With this recipe, you\'ll season fresh shrimp with garlic powder, and then triple dip: first into a beaten egg mixture, then into a flour and paprika combo, and finally into panko crumbs.

""The panko makes all the difference.""', 'What happens when a simple country chicken heads to the big city? It becomes pork! Yes, this breaded-and-fried meat-on-a-stick isn\'t chicken at all, it\'s chopped pork tenderloin (or pork shoulder).

""I love the simple combination of really good ricotta and fresh herbs baked with just enough eggs to hold things together,"" says Chef John.', 'You\'ll also want panko for lightly breaded appetizers like jalapeño poppers and stuffed mushrooms. ""These poppers were very good,"" says monica. ""Made these with the over-abundance of jalapeño peppers from my garden. I combined the two cheeses and used a Mexican cheese blend then sprinkled panko crumbs on top.""', 'The light flake of panko breadcrumbs also makes them essential for onion rings.

And if you\'re more into waffling than totting, they make tasty savory waffles, too.', 'Here\'s one for the end of summer when ripe tomatoes are in perfect peak form. You\'ll spread a mixture of Parmesan cheese, Panko crumbs, feta cheese, and parsley over puff pastry, then add a layer of sautéed onions and garlic, followed by a tomato layer. Garnish your galette with a sprinkle of fresh basil. ""A light and savory meal to use up all of those tomatoes from the garden,"" says tcasa.', 'A little panko gives these ground pork meatballs great texture. Cooked under the broiler and served with a lively dipping sauce, these Vietnamese-inspired meatballs offer an enticing balance of spicy, salty, tangy, and sweet flavors.

Here's how to do it."", 'Start, if you can, with larger chicken wings. Smaller wings can sometimes overcook when using a double-fry method. Separate the flats from the drumettes; discard the tips or save them for stock. Season the wings well with salt and pepper, and if you like, some minced ginger.

You'll need about 1/3-1/2 cup starch per pound of wings."", 'Coat the wings thoroughly, pressing the starch into the surface with a squeeze, and then tapping lightly to remove any excess. Arrange the coated wings on a rack over a sheet pan so that they stay dry.', ""While you may not have heard of double-frying—where a lower-heat oil blanching begins to cook the interior, then a second fry at a higher temp gives that perfect crisp and wonderful browning—you've eaten plenty of delicious foods cooked that way. For example, if you've munched on crispy frites with steak at a French bistro, you've experienced the wonder of double frying."", ""Here's how to double-fry chicken wings: Pour a quart of high-smoke point oil like peanut, avocado, or grapeseed into a countertop deep fryer or a heavy-bottomed pot with deep sides."", 'For your first fry, have your oil around 325° F. Fry the wings in batches for about 10-12 minutes until they are crisp, but blond, without much browning. Set the wings aside and increase the heat of your oil to 350°. Fry again until the exteriors are deeply browned and extra crunchy, and the interiors register at least 185°F on a meat thermometer.

Kimchi harnesses that power to create a uniquely spicy, salty, and satisfying condiment that enhances every dish it touches. Learn more about this Korean staple and the endless ways to use it."", ""Kimchi is a Korean fermented vegetable condiment, usually with a base of some type of cabbage. It's often flavored with various types of chilis or chili pastes, but the most common is a Korean red pepper flake called Gochugaru. Other flavor boosters like fish sauce or dried shrimp are often added as well as aromatics like ginger or garlic."", 'Kimchi can also be made with several types of radishes or other leafy vegetables like bok choy. There are many different types and recipes for kimchi, nearly as many recipes as families making it. Regional traditions combined with geographically available ingredients can shape recipes as well.', 'Kimchi can include many different combinations of ingredients, but generally, the method of getting from raw ingredients to a delicious jar of kimchi is the same. Like many fermented foods, kimchi starts with a salt brine. This is insurance against any harmful bacteria and ensures delicious fermentation and not spoilage. Then, just the good bacteria is left behind.', 'This type of bacteria feeds on sugar; the by-product is lactic acid, the same type of acid that gives yogurt its tang. A spice paste is added and massaged into the veggies and once everything is combined, the kimchi is firmly packed into jars. The lactic acid goes to work, partially breaking down the veggies and working on those delicious flavors.', ""Some choose to leave their kimchi for just a few days, while others leave it for much longer to heighten its sour flavor.One of the significant benefits of making kimchi at home is you can totally control the flavors to suit your preferences. Like your kimchi spicy? Up the chili paste. Cooking for vegetarians? Omit the fish sauce. Have some extra carrots kicking around? Add 'em in!"", ""There are more than 100 different varieties of kimchi out there, so finding a recipe tailored to your preferences is easy. If you're looking to start experimenting with making kimchi at home, a basic recipe with room for tweaks is a great place to start."", ""If you've never tried kimchi before but are a fan of any type of pickled or fermented foods, you'll probably love kimchi's funky tang. Some kimchi is spicy, while others are milder. In general, it has a distinct fermented flavor that plays well with all types of ingredients, especially rich, fatty flavors and salty items."", 'Depending on what veggies are used, the texture can be crunchy from radishes or daikon, or lightly crisp in the case of cabbage. If you happen to see a few types of kimchi at the store, snag a couple of different varieties and try them out to see which ones you like best. It never hurts to have a few different types on hand for different dishes.', 'Kimchi is a Korean dish, and many Koreans eat it every day, even multiple times per day. It goes well on the side of your favorite Korean dishes, especially things like pork belly or Bibimbap. Savory kimchi pancakes are a quick way to keep kimchi the star of the dish and are great at any time of day, especially when dunked in a salty dipping sauce or drizzled with spicy mayo.', 'Get the recipe: Corned Beef Kimchi Fried Rice', ""Kimchi can also jazz up an otherwise boring grilled cheese — just add a hefty scoop into your sandwich with some nice cheddar, it's a classic combo that brings a comfort food staple to a whole new level. If you're new to the wonderful world of kimchi cookery, a great way to try it out is simply mounded atop a steaming scoop of rice, crowned with a crispy fried egg. Once you've tried that, take the plunge into kimchi fried rice. You won't regret it."", 'Depending on where you live, you might be able to find at least one brand of kimchi in your local grocery store. The shelf-stable kind can usually be found in the international section or possibly with the pickled items. Some varieties of kimchi are not canned and sealed and are sold fresh, usually in the produce section near the tofu.', ""If you have a Korean or Asian supermarket in your community, patronize it. They'll generally have many different varieties, and you'll have lots more to choose from. They might even have locally made brands or unique varieties that you can't get anywhere else; it's more than worth the trip."", ""Some kimchi is sold shelf stable so until it's opened, it can be stored in a cabinet or pantry. If it's homemade or sold fresh, it should be stored in the fridge, any prolonged stint at room temperature could foster harmful bacteria or accelerate spoilage. So long as the liquid is covering the veggies and everything is submerged, your kimchi should stay fresh for months.""]"

Gochujang is one of those condiments. This Korean fermented pepper paste is packed with spice, funk, sweetness, and umami. Fair warning — once you introduce this stuff to your fridge, you won't be able to function without it. And you might be taking it down by the spoonful. Don't say you weren't warned."", ""This brick red, Korean condiment is made from peppers, glutinous (sticky) rice, fermented soy beans, aromatics (garlic, onions, sesame), sweeteners (syrups or sugar), and salt. It is a product of fermentation (like sauerkraut and kimchi), so it's got that quintessential funky flavor note. Depending on the kind of peppers that the paste is made of and the amount that's used will determine how spicy the gochujang is — if you prefer a less spice, you can opt for a mild gochujang. Because of the fermentation, the paste has a subtle sweetness, which is a nice counterbalance to the spiciness and salty, umami flavor."", ""Gochujang varies in its level of heat. Because all versions are a little different, it depends on the amount of red chili flakes that were used to make that particular brand or batch. If you're sensitive to spice, look for a mild gochujang, and don't be afraid to try several brands in order to see which one fits your taste best. You'd be surprised how the sweetness and funkiness of the rest of the condiment can cut through the heat. And hey, for any of the contenders that proved too hot for your palate, gift those containers to a couple of friends — might as well spread the gochujang love."", ""If you're ready to pull the trigger and try out this magical paste, you can buy some online, at Korean grocery stores, and some well-stocked grocery stores. Look for brands like Mother in Law's, Bibigo, or One Culture. Sometimes it's packaged in jars or bottles, while some brands are packaged in tubs. Regardless, it will always be in the refrigerated section. Remember, not all gochujang pastes are the same, so you should try out a few brands and decide for yourself which one you like best."", 'Buy It: Gochujang Hot Pepper Paste, 1.1lbs ($17.89, amazon.com)', ""If you'd rather take matters into your own hands and make gochujang right at home, you definitely can. Grab a recipe like this five-star Gochujang Sauce — you'll need gochugaru (Korean red chili flakes), sticky rice powder and/or dried soybeans, and some sort of sweetener (like honey, malt syrup, rice syrup or maple syrup). You'll need to heat all of the ingredients before sealing your homemade gochujang up in an airtight container and letting it sit for anywhere from a few days to 6 months. The longer it has to ferment, the more flavorful it will be."", ""Once you've got your hands on this stuff, it's time to put it to good use. This absolute flavor bomb of a condiment can take any marinade, braise, soup, or stew up a giant notch. Frying some chicken wings? Whip up a gochujang sauce with sesame oil, soy sauce, brown sugar, and scallions for an easy, game day app. Or, use this same gochujang sauce and toss it in a cucumber salad. Rub gochujang on potatoes, seafood, or pulled pork. Remember, this stuff has extremely concentrated flavor, so a small spoonful can go a long way."", 'Like miso, another fermented product, gochujang needs to be sealed and refrigerated after opening the package.', ""The good thing about this condiment is that it's going to last you for a while. It can last up to 2 years when properly sealed in a refrigerator.

Bul, meaning ""fire,"" and gogi, meaning ""meat,"" originated in Korea\'s Goguryeo era (the 1st century BCE to the 7th century CE), and once you taste these perfectly caramelized morsels of sweet and savory meat, you\'ll understand why this dish has stood the test of time. The tables at Korean restaurants even feature built-in charcoal or gas grills for guests to enjoy this iconic communal dining experience, combining meat and fire served with rice, lettuce leaves, and sumptuous sides (more on that below) in handmade bites, personalized to delight your own unique taste buds.', ""While you can prepare your Korean barbecue with a variety of meats like pork ribs, brisket, beef tongue, pork belly or chicken, the definitive version is beef bulgogi. Ribeye, sirloin, or tenderloin are the recommended cuts, but if you're cooking on a budget, try flank steak or skirt steak with a few extra hours of marinating time. Look for a hunk of meat with nice consistent marbling throughout. This beautiful marbling paired with the mouthwatering marinade is what gives you that melt-in-your-mouth tenderness."", 'Next, you will want to cut the meat, against the grain, into paper-thin slices. Some recipes suggest slicing the beef while frozen for uber-thin uniformity. You can also just have your local butcher pre-slice them for you.', ""An authentic bulgogi marinade combines soy sauce, white or brown sugar, and sesame oil with minced, grated, or blended garlic, onion, and Asian pear. The true authentic Asian pear—a sweet fruit that is more like an apple—is a must. So, head to your local Korean market for the good stuff. Some recipes also call for sweet rice cooking wine, apple juice, or even Coca-Cola for added sweetness. If you want some added depth of flavor, incorporate gochujang, a fermented red chili pepper paste that is ubiquitous in Korean kitchens. The thick, crimson condiment features a sweet, savory, slightly spicy, smoky, funky taste that is to-die-for. It's got a little kick, but if you're looking for even more heat, go with a classic Asian chili garlic sauce. Mix up your marinade, then douse your paper-thin beef slices in the tasty sauce. Let it marinade for at least 2 hours or overnight.Try Chef John's version of Beef Bulgogi, which features a marinade made with Asian pear and Korean chili flakes (gochugaru). Watch Chef John make bulgogi:"", ""Once you're ready to cook, remove the marinated beef and let it come to room temperature—about 30 minutes. The actual barbecuing process hardly takes any time at all. Let the grill, cast-iron skillet, or wok get very hot before searing begins, so that the meat sizzles and caramelizes with crispy brown edges and a tender center. Once you see moisture forming on the top side, flip the slices. It only takes a few minutes—you don't want to cook it too long or it will be dry and tough. If you're looking for a juicier result with a sauce-like effect, you can pour all of the marinated beef and its juices into a skillet or wok. Some prefer this so that the savory-sweet sauce can flavor their rice. Common garnishes include chopped scallions and toasted sesame seeds."", ""Bulgogi's charm lies not only in its incredible flavor, but also in the hands-on, communal experience with handmade bites that can be tailored to dazzle each diner's palate."", 'Just picture it: To start this iconic meal, an authentic Korean table is laden with an assortment of small side dishes known as banchan, which are meant to be enjoyed as appetizers and complements for the barbecue bites throughout the meal. There are hundreds of different types of banchan—spicy cucumber salad, seasoned egg in soy sauce, stir-fried spicy fish cake, dried seaweed, candied sweet potatoes, enoki mushroom pancakes, pickled jalapeno-radish, stir-fried anchovies, seasoned mung bean sprouts, stir-fried zucchini, steamed eggplant, or seasoned greens like spinach, cabbage, or watercress, to name a few.', ""The thinly sliced raw marinated beef is brought to cook on the table's center grill before everyone's eyes. If you want to create this authentic Korean restaurant experience in your own home, get a portable Korean BBQ grill for your home table, and cook the raw slices of meat for all to enjoy the sizzlin' sounds and tantalizing aromas. Another option for serving is on a sizzling fajita platter—most Korean markets will have multiple options available. The beautifully seared beef is most often paired with steamed white rice, lettuces, and kimchi."", 'Ssam, meaning ""wrapped,"" refers to the Korean culinary method in which rice, meat, or other fillings are wrapped in leafy vegetables. Any combination of lettuces that you love can be used to form your lettuce wraps. Popular ones are Koran perilla leaves, red-leaf lettuce, kaenip, Boston lettuce, or steamed or parboiled cabbage. The wrap is meant to be a bite-sized morsel, and everyone has their favored method. Some use multiple lettuce leaves and place a little rice inside with their meat. The addition of kimchi is par for the course. Then any manner of spicy sauces or banchan bites can be added into the mix, as well as ssamjang—a beloved Korean barbecue sauce that is tangy, fermented, and absolutely delightful when paired with the sweet-and-savory beef bulgogi.', 'While ssam is a popular method for eating a bulgogi feast, others prefer to eat their beef atop or mixed into rice, adding in any desired banchan and sauces. And if you want to pair these incredible bulgogi flavors with a beverage, try Korea\'s national drink: soju—a clear rice wine similar to Japan\'s sake. Geonbae! (That\'s ""Cheers!"" in Korean!)', 'Now gather a group of your favorite people and create a bulgogi experience that will truly wow them.', 'Here are some top-rated bulgogi recipes to get you started:']"

With their artfully arranged, colorful, and mouthwatering ingredients, these bowls are so beautiful, they\'ve naturally also taken up a hefty chunk of real estate on social media. But what you might not realize is that the original ""beautiful bowl"" most likely originated in Korea.', 'It\'s called bibimbap (pronounced ""bee-BIM-bop"")—bibim meaning ""mixed"" and bap meaning ""rice."" This beloved Korean bowl incorporates steamed white rice with assorted fresh, marinated, and sautéed vegetables along with raw or seared meat, if desired. It is always served with an egg, most often served sunny-side-up, as well as strips of crunchy and light seasoned seaweed. Kimchi or other fermented veggies, as well as pickled ingredients, lend added depth while the gochujang—Korea\'s iconic fermented red chili pepper paste—imbues the bowls with a smoky, savory, slightly sweet, slightly spicy flavor profile. The tastes and textures are crunchy and luscious, spicy and sweet with pickled and fermented notes.', ""When you see the most gorgeous finished product, you might think bibimbap is too complicated for you, but you'd be wrong. It's been around for centuries and ancient lore has it straddling the highest and lowest echelons of society: Some say it was served to emperors and government officials at lavish parties, while others say that it was a cheap and convenient one-bowl meal that farmers' wives made using seasonal ingredients mixed with rice. Either way, these legends still ring true as bibimbap can be as complicated or as simple as you want it to be."", ""The customizable nature of this dish is an element that cannot be over-celebrated. Bibimbap can be altered to fit any lifestyle or diet—whether that is beginner- or advanced-level cook; adventurous or safe eater, or vegan or ultra-decadent diet. It must be noted, though, that bibimbap by nature is quite healthy with rice and colorful vegetables plus meat, fish, egg, or tofu—providing a low-calorie dish that is high in fiber, carbohydrates, and protein. Because of the dish's flexibility, it is also great for gatherings—a culinary canvas where each eater is also an artist, creating a work of edible art tailored to their own taste buds."", 'To make your own bibimbap at home, you\'ll need short-grain white, or ""sticky,"" rice as your base. Some prefer brown rice, if going for a healthier spin. If you\'re a meat lover, you\'ll need your protein of choice: Traditionally it\'s served with raw beef and raw egg yolks, but if that\'s not your bag, you can substitute with your favorite cooked proteins like seafood, chicken, or over-medium fried egg. Then any variety of your favorite vegetables. In Korea, these are known as banchan and are served at every meal. These small side dishes become integral to the bowl mixture, so do your homework to find the ones that tantalize your own taste buds. The most common bibimbap veggies are lightly seasoned and sautéed julienned carrots, onion, spinach, shiitake mushrooms, and mung bean sprouts, as well as raw lettuces and kimchi.', 'The ""secret sauce"" is quite literally the sauce: gochujang. Different recipes call for different variations and with a little online sleuthing, you can find a recipe befitting your palate. Some use gochujang as is, while others add sesame oil, water, and sugar for a sweeter effect and others add more garlicky, spicy, or vinegary elements.', 'Place the rice in the bottom of the bowl, and arrange the vibrant banchan and protein around the edges, reserving the central spot for the perfectly cooked egg. Drizzle your choices of soy sauce, sesame oil, and gochujang sauce over the base ingredients, and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds if desired.', 'And there is a pretty awesome upgrade to your everyday bibimbap called dolsot bibimbap. Dolsot refers to a ""hot stone pot."" Sesame oil is poured into this hot pot vessel and the rice base is placed atop it, left to sizzle and form a crunchy, toasty crust while the veggies and meats sear and steam above. This decadent version of bibimbap is the more expensive option served in Korean restaurants. And once you taste the sticky rice\'s crunchy, chewy, crispy mutations because of this hot stone—plus the way it makes the veggies and sauces sing—you\'ll understand why.', ""The authentic Korean way to eat bibimbap dictates that you mix everything up—the golden egg yolk; the fresh, fermented, and sauteed vegetables; the raw or seared savory protein of choice; and the soy, sesame, and gochujang sauces. But if you're a military-style eater, feel free to go your own way. After all, that is the beauty of beautiful bibimbap."", 'Check out our complete collection of Korean Recipes.']"

This staple of Korean cooking is used in a wide range of traditional dishes for both its taste and vibrant appearance. Read on to learn why your spice pantry should always include gochugaru.', 'Gochugaru is made from bright red Korean chile peppers with the seeds and membranes removed. They\'re always dried, but look out for the words ""taekyung"" or ""taeyangcho"" on your packages of Korean gochugaru, this denotes the product being specifically sun-dried, which lends itself to being higher-quality and having a better taste. The dried peppers are then blended up, often into large flakes, but they\'re sometimes finely ground into a powder too.', ""Despite its intensely red appearance, gochugaru isn't nearly as spicy as one would expect. It has a subtle heat, but that kick of capsaicin is offset with fruity and sweet notes. Sun-dried varieties of gochugaru feature a mild smokiness, creating an extra depth of flavor."", ""Gochugaru is the backbone of many Korean staples like kimchi, to which it lends a hint of heat and the beloved bright red color, along with gochujang, where it acts as the base for the traditional pepper paste. It's also commonly sprinkled into dishes like soups and stews, such as this dakdoritang or kimchi stew."", ""Gochugaru isn't just reserved to Korean cooking, though. Its unique flavor makes it ideal for sprinkling into marinades for grilled meats, brines for pickled veggies, or even amping up salad dressings. Use it as a milder alternative in recipes that call for red pepper flakes, or as a one-to-one swap in for Aleppo pepper."", ""Gochugaru can be found at any Korean market, with most stores featuring several shelves of different brands, sizes, and heat levels of the pepper powder. This can be overwhelming for most gochugaru newcomers, so we recommend trying a few brands online, then finding your preferred variety. Once you've picked your favorite, you'll be able to easily walk into your local Korean store and shop with confidence. For basic starters, we recommend the Tae-kyung Gochugaru Flakes, or you can opt for the more finely ground Tae-kyung Gochugaru Powder, which is best if you want the flakes to disappear into whatever you're cooking."", 'Related Content:']"

Nonetheless, this staple in Thai cooking can be an incredibly simple way to add tons of bright, powerful flavors to a dish with little to no effort. Here's what you need to know before you add it to your kitchen repertoire."", 'What is curry paste?', 'While curry powder is a blend of dried, ground spices that you can often find between the cumin and dill in the spice aisle at the supermarket, curry paste is like a turbocharged version. It features many of the same spices, such as turmeric, coriander, chili powder, and cumin, then adds in oil, garlic, lemongrass, galangal (or Thai ginger) and some chilies, the latter being the ingredient that gives curry paste its distinct color and flavor.', 'Are there different kinds of curry paste?', ""As far as Thai curry pastes go, there are three main types: red, yellow, and green, all of which start with the same base ingredients. Traditional red curry paste can feature up to 20 different dried chilies, among them bird's eye chilies and Thai long chilies. Green curry paste features many of the same chilies as red but in their fresh state (as opposed to dried), plus cilantro and kaffir lime leaves to give it a vibrant, green color. Meanwhile, yellow curry paste gets its color from fresh turmeric and curry powder."", 'What does curry paste taste like?', 'The spiciest option, red curry paste is rich and fiery. Green curry paste is often considered the most popular of the three because it offers a mild, balanced flavor that is both rich and herbaceous. Yellow curry paste is heartwarming and slightly sweet and its spiciness can vary depending on the types of chilies used.', 'How is curry paste used?', ""The most common use for curry paste is, unsurprisingly, in curries. To make one, you typically add the curry paste to a skillet, followed by the protein or veggies, then a liquid such as stock or coconut milk. The mixture is then simmered slowly until the sauce is thick and fragrant and everything is cooked through and is usually served over rice. However, you can bring curry paste's deep flavor to a variety of recipes. You can use it in a marinade or as a rub for chicken, fish, or beef. Mixing it with vinegar or yogurt will result in a tasty salad dressing. What's more, adding curry paste at the beginning of cooking can help you build flavor in soups and stews."", 'What should I look for when buying curry paste?', ""You'll find curry paste in the international aisle at most supermarkets—Thai Kitchen (which makes green and red curry paste) is the brand that is most widely available. It can be stored in the cupboard until you open it, then it should move to the fridge. As far as flavors, each brand will likely have a slightly different recipe, so experimentation is the best way to find the recipe that suits your taste. If you have a shellfish allergy, make sure you check the ingredients list, since many curry pastes are made with shrimp paste."", 'Make your own Thai Red Curry Paste.', 'What about Indian curry?', ""Next to Thai, curry is most prevalent in Indian cooking. It's true that an Indian curry may look similar to a Thai curry upon serving, but the cooking process is different. Thai curry starts with curry paste and is commonly thickened with coconut milk. Meanwhile, Indian curry begins with a base of tomatoes and onions that have been cooked down, followed by the addition of a variety of dried spices that transform it into a curry, and finally thickened with yogurt or cream.

Plus, get our top ten recipes using lime leaves so you cook up dishes showcasing this unforgettable flavor at home."", ""Lime leaves impart a bright and pleasantly tangy taste that you'd expect from any citrus.

These little leaves have the power to synergize all of these flavorful ingredients and harmonize dishes with many distinct flavors."", ""These leaves don't come from the limes that you see in U.S. supermarkets.

Others sell them frozen in small or medium-sized bags. You won't notice much of a difference in quality or flavor between the two, so don't hesitate to buy them frozen. If you can't find these options, look for dried lime leaves or canisters of powder."", 'Before tossing whole leaves into dishes, use a sharp knife to remove the tough part of the center rib so that you can eat the whole leaf without chomping through that tough and stringy part of the plant. The powdered form is very fine, so it can be sprinkled in cooked or fresh dishes at any point during cooking. But use small amounts at a time and then taste your dish before adding more because the flavor can be quite potent.', ""Keep frozen leaves in the freezer. If you buy them fresh, store them in the fridge, and if you don't use them all within a few weeks, transfer them to the freezer.

How can anyone make lasagna without baking it? Well, trust us,"" says Shauna James Ahern. ""This lasagna is well worth making. If you have a 6- or 7-inch springform pan and you kept the trivet that came with your Instant Pot, you can make a delicious layered lasagna pie in 30 minutes. And if you want to make it ahead, you can prep the lasagna, put it in the freezer, then put it right into the Instant Pot for an easy dinner.""', '""If you love risotto but hate all of the stirring and time involved, you\'ll love making it in the Instant Pot,"" says lutzflcat.

""She was considered the Julia Child of Italian food, and at a time when most Americans thought \'Bolognese\' was spaghetti sauce with chunks of hamburger, Marcella taught us just how magnificent this meat sauce could be. I like to toss it with some mezzi rigatoni and serve it with a little grated Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of parsley.""', '""This is the type of dish I never make the same way twice,"" says Chef John. ""To make minestrone soup precisely same way every time, using a very specific list of ingredients and amounts, is to trample on the soul of this Italian classic. Still, I hope you give this amazing minestrone recipe a try...but only once.', '""This recipe produces one of the more uniquely flavored braised beef dishes I\'ve ever had,"" says Chef John. ""Beef shank is the traditional cut of meat to use, but short ribs worked really well. You could even use beef chuck, cut into two-inch pieces. Keep cooking until a fork goes in easily. The story goes that terracotta tile workers in Impruneta, Tuscany, would place this stew into clay pots and cook it in their still-hot kilns overnight where it would be ready in the morning.""', '""There are only two things you need for great lasagna: a thick, rich, super-meaty meat sauce and lots of it, and a ricotta filling where only the finest cheeses are welcomed,"" says Chef John. ""For the sauce, I love a combination of half Italian sausage and half lean ground beef. I also like lots of sauce.""', '""In Italy, \'saltimbocca\' means \'jumps in the mouth,\'"" explains Chef John. ""This tender, juicy and delicious pork tenderloin is finished with a rich meaty sauce and will certainly please your palate. Feel free to use the more classic veal loin, but the pork tenderloin really works beautifully. It\'s just as tender, and maybe even a bit more forgiving if slightly overcooked.""', '""This is stuffed, rolled beef that\'s cooked in a little bit of tomato sauce,"" says Chef John. ""It is one of my all-time favorite Italian recipes, and a great dish to learn, since it can be varied in many delicious ways. So consider this video recipe a lesson in the technique of pounding, stuffing, and rolling the braciole - which will hopefully inspire you to fill it with your favorite dried fruit, nuts, herbs, cheese, etc.""', '""Agrodolce, a generic Italian term for any type of sweet and sour condiment, really shines when used for braising chunks of succulent pork shoulder,"" says Chef John. ""This soul-warming comfort food is amazing served on rice, pasta, polenta, or, as seen here, a big pile of ricotta mashed potatoes. I\'m not sure if Italians barbecue like we do here in the States, but the sauce very much reminded me of something we\'d brush on a rack of ribs while sipping a cold beer.""', '""I spent a few days in Florence about 30 years ago, and while I don\'t remember much, I do recall my surprise at how delicious the Tuscan fish stew was,"" says Chef John. ""What I found so interesting was how herbs like oregano, sage, and rosemary, which I\'d only associated with meat, were also used with seafood. Also, FYI just in case any old-school Tuscans are coming over: I hear that for this to qualify as an official Italian fish stew you need use at least 5 different types of seafood, which is both insane and adorable. Serve with crusty bread.""', '""Spaghetti al tonno is one of my all-time favorite go-to pasta dishes,"" says Chef John. ""I love a classic meat sauce as much as the next half-Italian, but when I want something quick and easy for a weeknight meal, I reach for the tuna. What if you don\'t like fish? Then this is perfect. The taste and texture is really closer to a veal sauce than one made with fish.""', '""I love chicken parm, especially when it\'s made with fresh mozzarella, which it almost never is in restaurants,"" says Chef John. ""Of course, at home we can use the real stuff, but it can be pricey. So I tried something new--a cheese spread using ricotta fortified with sharp Cheddar. The creamy ricotta made a great base into which you could add any melting cheese. I really enjoyed the Cheddar, but I\'d like to try this with other options, such as provolone, fontina, or even Gruyere. ""', '""Homemade meatballs are a very easy to make,"" says Chef John. ""And since we skip the very messy step of pan-frying these before they hit the sauce, it becomes downright simple. Here I use a standard half-beef/half-pork mixture. You can substitute water or beef broth for the milk, if preferred. The other trick here is to soak the bread crumbs in milk for a moister, more tender meatball. This is one of those dishes that just get better -- more tender and flavorful-- the next day.""', '""This classic Italian-American comfort food works with any kind of sausage, but I like the fennel and anise flavors of sweet Italian sausage with the beans -- it\'s a hearty soup that\'s fast and easy to put together,"" says Chef John.', '""The key to this panzanella is frying the bread cubes in loads of olive oil in a skillet, which obviously makes them crispy,"" says Chef John. ""But the healthful fat also soaks into the bread cubes and renders them semi-waterproof, or dressing-proof. The same goes for the dusting of Parmesan cheese applied halfway through the crisping process.""', '""When the weather gets a little colder, this pork stew really hits the spot,"" says Chef John. ""Pork shoulder meat is braised in a creme fraiche sauce until amazingly tender and delicious. Serve on polenta with crisp sage leaves for garnish.""', '""One of my earliest and most vivid food memories was when my uncle Bill would make his famous dried Italian sausage every Christmas Eve,"" says Chef John. ""They\'d be fried after Midnight Mass and served on bread with roasted red peppers. This fresh version was inspired by those. If you can manage not to eat them right away, letting them dry for a day or two really deepens the flavor, and firms up the texture as well, in true Uncle Billy fashion.""', 'Here\'s a meat sauce that\'s very old, virtually unknown, but very tasty. ""I have no idea why this amazingly flavorful Genovese-style meat sauce isn\'t way more popular than it is,"" says Chef John. ""It\'s quite simply one of the best pasta sauces you\'ll ever taste, thanks to a very slow cooking process, and massive amounts of onions. Once everything is prepped, the recipe couldn\'t be easier. Simmer until the meat and onions melt into each other, and serve.""', '""This technique turns out beautifully light, tender gnocchi every time and are just as good, if not better, than the classic potato-based gnocchi,"" says Chef John. ""And much easier. Plus you can make them ahead of time and brown them in butter before serving.""', '""This is my favorite method of making Italian sausage spaghetti,"" says Chef John. ""By browning the sausages first and then cooking them in the sauce at a long, slow simmer, the sausage is loaded with flavor and firm, but tender--almost meatball-like in texture. And we hardly need any seasonings because the long cook time allows the sauce to get infused with all the sausage-y goodness!""', '""We\'re going to simplify traditional porchetta by making a smaller, simpler version using pork shoulder,"" says Chef John. ""It makes a great sandwich, especially topped with some fried, crispy pancetta.""', '""This comforting and substantial white bean and sausage stew is a soup that eats like a meal!"" says Chef John. ""Browning the sausage in a dry pan creates a beautiful fond that adds rich flavor. With beans, greens, and sausage, this stew is incredibly nutritious and warms you from the inside out. Serve with a hunk of crusty Italian bread.""', '""I\'ve wanted to make carabaccia ever since I found out it was the ancient ancestor of French onion soup,"" says Chef John. ""They say that when made with vegetable broth, it was the favorite soup of vegetarian Leonardo da Vinci. Now you can add these interesting facts to your dinner party conversation repertoire. As for the cinnamon, the safe play is to not add any and live happily ever after. But in tiny amounts it lends a mysterious, warming background note.""']"

Its pungent flavor is composed of earthy/musty, green, hay and minty notes. Try it in Exquisite Pizza Sauce.', 'Basil: Used in tomato sauces, pestos, pizzas, cheeses, and Italian seasonings, basil is slightly bitter and musty--tea-like, with green/grassy, hay, and minty notes. Early Romans made basil a symbol of love and fertility; young Italian suitors wore sprigs of it as a sign of their marital intentions. Try it in Classic Pesto.', 'Rosemary: Popular in seasoning blends for meats and Mediterranean cuisines, rosemary has a distinctive pine-woody aroma and a fresh, bittersweet flavor. Try it in Rosemary Pasta in Roasted Garlic Sauce.', 'Fennel: Used to flavor fish, sausages, baked goods, and liqueurs, fennel has a sweet, licorice-like flavor similar to anise but less intense, with slight menthol and musty/green flavor notes. It is also one of the few plants where the roots, stalk, seeds, fronds and pollen are all used. Originating in the Mediterranean, fennel was carried north from Italy by monks, and today it is used in nearly every cuisine. Try it in Baked Fennel with Parmesan.', 'Sage: Highly aromatic, with piney, woody notes, sage is ideal for flavoring pork, beef, poultry, lamb, tomatoes, squash, potatoes, rice, pasta and much more. Traditionally, sage was used for its antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Try it in Italian Pork Tenderloin.', 'Flat-leaf parsley: Also known as ""Italian parsley,"" its flavor and aroma profile is green and vegetative. It is popular in egg dishes, soups, stews, stocks and with other herbs to bring out their flavor. Parsley also adds visual appeal to many dishes. Try it in Andrew\'s Herb Risotto.', 'Semolina pasta: Most good pasta is made from semolina, durum wheat more coarsely ground than regular wheat flour. Try it with Fresh Semolina and Egg Pasta.', 'Polenta: This cornmeal mush is a staple of northern Italy and can be eaten at any meal. For something different, fry up squares of chilled leftover polenta. Try it in Vegan Polenta with Ragu.', 'Arborio or Carnaroli rice: The high starch content of these chubby, short-grained rice varieties is essential for risotto. The slow cooking and steady stirring allow the grains to gradually release starch, thickening the dish and resulting in a creamy textured risotto. Try arborio rice in Gourmet Mushroom Risotto and carnaroli rice in Risotto a la Pavese.', 'Olive oil: Ranging in color from grassy green to pale champagne-gold, olive oil adds flavor and luscious mouth feel to foods. Extra-virgin olive oil is delicious and redolent, best in salads and marinades or poured directly over pastas and other foods. Try it in Olive Oil-Poached Tuna.', 'Balsamic vinegar: A special vinegar from Modena, Italy, that achieves its beautiful color and depth of flavor only after spending years in wooden barrels, where it concentrates into a complex syrup. Drizzle balsamic vinegar over figs, strawberries, or Parmigiano Reggiano for fantastic flavor combinations. Try it in Balsamic Bruschetta.Tomatoes: Delectable raw or cooked, tomatoes pair beautifully with so many foods and flavors: cheeses, meats, onions, garlic, peppers and herbs; pizza, pastas, salsas, salads, soups, stews — and on and on.', 'Eggplant: A very versatile veggie, eggplants can be baked, boiled and fried. However, they can really sponge-up while frying in oil. To avoid excess absorption, coat eggplant slices well with batter or crumbs before sliding them into hot oil. Try them in Italian Baked Eggplant with Parmesan (Parmigiana di Melanzane).', 'Porcini mushrooms: These wild mushrooms are usually found in dried form and have a meaty texture and woodsy flavor. They are particularly good in soups, stuffing and stews and with braised meats. Before using in recipes, soak dried porcinis in hot water for about 20 minutes — and use some of the soaking water in your recipe. Try them in True Italian Porcini Mushroom Risotto.', 'Cannellini beans: The large, white kidney beans are available dry or canned and are popular in salads, soups, and stews. Try them in Italian White Bean and Sausage Stew.', 'Lemons: Lemons add bright flavor to such a wide range of dishes, from sweet to savory. This juicy, acidic fruit is also an important ingredient in drinks, including limoncello, the famous lemon liqueur from southern Italy. Try lemons in Lemon Chicken Piccata.', ""Parmigiano-Reggiano: This is the real deal, the pinnacle of Parmesan cheeses, whose rich, complex flavor comes from the aging process. Made from skimmed or partially skimmed cow's milk, Parmigiano-Reggiano is a hard, grating cheese with a light golden rind and a straw-colored interior. Try our collection of Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese Recipes."", 'Mozzarella: This mild white cheese is tops for pizza, lasagna, and other classic Italian dishes. Fresh mozzarella has a more delicate flavor and is not as elastic as the drier semi-soft kind typically sold pre-packaged. Fresh mozzarella is generally made from whole milk, packaged in water or whey and labeled ""Italian style."" Check out our collection of Mozzarella Recipes.', 'Ricotta cheese: An important ingredient in classic Italian dishes like lasagna and manicotti, ricotta is a moist fresh cheese that\'s rich and smooth. The word ""ricotta"" means ""re-cooked"" in Italian and refers to the fact that ricotta is made by draining the whey off of other cheeses and heating it. So, technically, ricotta isn\'t cheese but a byproduct of cheese-making. Try making your own Sicilian Homemade Ricotta Cheese. And explore our collection of Ricotta Cheese Recipes.', ""Capers: These are the tiny flower buds from a bush that grows in the Mediterranean. They're typically pickled in vinegary brine or sometimes packed in salt. For something so small, they add big pungent flavor to sauces, condiments, and meat and vegetable dishes. Try them in Chicken Piccata with Capers"", 'Pine nuts: Italian pine nuts have a delicate flavor and are used in sweet and savory dishes. They are probably best known as an ingredient that lends big flavor to Italian pesto.', 'Almonds: Available whole, sliced, chopped, candied, smoked, in paste, blanched, roasted and salted, almonds are loaded with good stuff. They contain calcium, fiber, folic acid, magnesium, potassium, riboflavin and vitamin E. Toast them to intensify the flavor and add a satisfying crunch. Try them in Almond Biscotti.', 'Prosciutto di Parma: Another classic ingredient from the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy in the province of Parma. Proscuitto means ""ham"" in Italian and salt-cured prosciutto di Parma is tops in the field. The secret is the pig\'s diet of chestnuts and whey. Try it with Prosciutto e Melone (Italian Ham and Melon).', 'Anchovies: Real anchovies are found only in the Mediterranean. They are typically filleted, cured in salt, and canned in oil. Anchovies can be soaked in cool water to dilute the saltiness. Use sparingly to add depth of flavor to sauces, salads, and pizza. Try it in Puttanesca Pasta.', 'Olives: Along with grapes and bread, olives were part of the sacred triad of Roman ingredients. They remain an important ingredient in Italian cuisine, appearing in everything from antipasto plates, to pasta and secondi dishes. Try them in Sicilian Olive Chicken.', 'Check out our collection of Italian Recipes.']"

The bread is then served warm either with a topping spooned over or with a topping on the side so each person can build their own bruschetta. Bruschetta is meant to be served as a hand-held finger food, large enough for one or two bites.', ""You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:"", 'The best bread for bruschetta has a sturdy crust and is firm enough to hold the bruschetta topping. Choose a loaf of Italian bread, such as ciabatta, for a more traditional bruschetta. This recipe uses slices of French bread, like a baguette. Slice the bread on the diagonal at least ¼-inch thick or more to make an oval shape.', ""You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here are a few of our favorite tips for making the best bruschetta every time:"", ""· Quality counts: The beauty of a simple recipe like bruschetta is that it showcases the flavor of the individual ingredients. For this recipe, you can really taste the difference when you use ripe tomatoes and fresh (not dried) basil; the best olive oil and balsamic vinegar you can afford, and hand-grated Parmesan cheese instead of pre-packaged grated cheese.· Add flavor with garlic: As an alternative to adding minced raw garlic to the tomato mixture, cut a peeled clove of garlic in half lengthwise and lightly rub the cut side over the slightly roughened surface of the toasted bread to impart a hint of garlic flavor. Rub on a little more garlic for a stronger flavor, if you wish. But watch out: A little garlic goes a long way.· Be patient: Make the tomato mixture and let it sit for a couple of hours so the flavors can develop more complexity. Yes, the tomatoes may give off a lot of juice as they marinate, but if you think the mixture is too juicy come serving time, simply use a slotted spoon to lift out the bruschetta topping as you spoon it over the bread. Don't toss the liquid, though — lots of people love to dip into it with extra bread.

And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home."", ""In fact, chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in your own kitchen. The main problem I have with most versions of Chicken Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much sauce and cheese that it ends up being a big soggy clump of chicken and cheese. But it doesn't have to be that way, not with this method."", ""Unlike many restaurant preparations, this method doesn't overwhelm the chicken with sauce and cheese. The key to great non-soggy chicken Parmesan? Don't put any sauce under the chicken cutlets, just a little bit of sauce on top, so the breading stays relatively crisp. If you like a lot of sauce on your chicken Parmesan, that's fine, you can always serve extra sauce on the side. I also use some actual Parmesan cheese in this recipe! Curiously, most versions of chicken Parmesan only use mozzarella. Here, I'm going with a delicious mixture of fresh mozzarella, tangy Provolone and real Parmesan."", ""Another little trick I employ here is to add some grated Parmesan to the breadcrumbs, which adds another layer of flavor.

Then don't bother with salting the flour and bread crumbs."", '3. Add Parmesan to the bread crumbs Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated Parmesan cheese.

Rest before cookingBefore frying, let the breaded chicken sit on the counter for about 15 minutes to allow the coating to adhere to the chicken breast.', ""5. Go easy on the sauce THE KEY: Don't drown the poor breaded and fried chicken in sauce and smother it in cheese. Too much of a good thing is too much. You did all the work creating a crisp coating, why make it soggy with too much sauce and cheese?"", ""6. Make sure your oven is hot, hot, hot Be sure your oven is completely preheated to 450 F.

Thaw frozen shrimp before using.· Pasta: This recipe uses a 16-ounce package of linguine, but you can substitute the pasta of your choice, like angel hair pasta, fettuccine, or spaghetti.· Butter: Use unsalted butter. You can add salt to taste later in the recipe.· Extra-virgin olive oil: The flavor of the olive oil comes through in this recipe, so use the best quality.· Shallots and garlic: These aromatics add flavor and fragrance to shrimp scampi.· White wine: Use a dry, crisp white wine for shrimp scampi sauce. Pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc are good choices, and you can drink the leftover wine with dinner.· Lemon juice: Use freshly squeezed lemon juice for the best flavor.· Seasonings: Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper amplify the flavors, and a pinch of dried red pepper flakes give shrimp scampi a subtle kick.

Sprinkle a generous amount of salt over the eggplant slices to draw out the moisture, then wipe it away when it's time to fry.· When you're baking the coated eggplant slices, it doesn't hurt to turn on the broiler at the end.

Many dishes skip the usual tortilla-beans-rice trio altogether: Think vibrant soups, messy sandwiches, and a cheesy grilled corn salad. Others are specific to their region, like a shrimp classic from the coastal state of Sinaloa or tortilla pizzas from Oaxaca. All are worth adding to your Mexican meal rotation, especially with these easy, authentic recipes.', ""We all love Mexican flavors and plate-sized pizzas, so it's a wonder this super-simple dish isn't a staple at home or at most neighborhood Mexican restaurants. This Oaxacan dish consists of a large tortilla that's topped with refried beans and seared or baked, then finished with toppings like cotija cheese, tomato, and avocado. It's different from tostadas, which are smaller and deep-fried. Try these Mexican-inspired Fiesta Corn Tortilla Pizzas for a true tlayuda experience, or use the tortilla pizza inspiration for crowd-pleasing BBQ Chicken Tortilla Pizzas."", ""This light, brothy chicken soup gets its brightness from a generous dose of fresh lime juice. It comes from the Yucatan region in the Gulf of Mexico, where it's just as welcome on a hot day as on a cool one. Just like tortilla soup, crispy tortilla strips are a common garnish. The chicken and lime are the constants in most recipes; the veggies, herbs, and chiles vary from house to house. Nearly 100 5-star reviews make this Sopa de Lima recipe a great place to start."", 'The original elote was sold as an on-the-go snack on the streets of Mexico City. The blueprint: Corn on the cob brushed with mayo, coated in crumbled cotija or queso fresco, sprinkled with ground chile, and doused in lime juice. This Elote Salad keeps those same flavors but takes the corn off the cob for an easy-to-eat side. Serve at your next cookout, add to your burrito bowl, or top a taco or quesadilla.', ""Menudo is the unofficial soup of Mexico. You'll find it served all over the country at casual family gatherings, birthdays, wedding receptions, and (notoriously) as a next-morning hangover cure. Traditionally, tripe is boiled for hours until tender, then added to a spicy, chile-laced broth with hominy and lime. Recipe creator Gustavo06 sticks to tradition with his Menudo Rojo, but you could swap the tripe for stew beef."", 'If beef tacos make you think of ground beef and lots of seasoning, you have to give barbacoa a try. Traditionally, a whole goat or sheep is buried in an underground oven and slowly cooked overnight. Modern versions use beef cuts like chuck roast and are braised in the oven or cooked in the slow cooker. This Barbacoa-Style Shredded Beefuses the slow cooker. The result is so tender you could pull the meat apart with a fork. Pile onto tacos, tostadas, or burritos.', 'The city of Guadalajara is known for this ""drowned"" sandwich. Think of it as the Mexican equivalent of a French dip: A roll stuffed with thinly sliced meat, then ""half drowned"" (served with a thin, chile-flavored sauce for dipping) or ""well drowned"" (completely submerged in the sauce). Like all big sandwiches, it\'s messy in the best possible way. Give it a try with this Drowned Beef Sandwich with Chipotle Sauce (Torta Ahogada) recipe.', 'What makes this Mexican soup different from a tortilla soup or chili is the addition of hominy—a type of corn that\'s been dried and rehydrated to give it a chewy, starchy texture. Just like chili, you\'ll find white and red versions, vegetarian and meat versions, and loaded and simplified versions. Enjoy this Slow Cooker Pozole with lots of fresh toppings. ""Traditional Mexican Posole is served with shredded cabbage, lime wedges, avocado, onion, cilantro, and, of course, warm tortillas,"" says Jules, who submitted the recipe.', ""While cochinita means baby pig, most versions of this slow-roasted pork dish begin with pork shoulder. A citrus-heavy marinade helps to tenderize the meat. It's then wrapped in banana leaves and gently cooked in an underground oven (called a píib) until fall-apart tender. A standard oven cooks the pork in this Cochinita Pibil recipe."", 'A dish that translates to ""chile water"" may not sound like much, which means you\'ll be incredibly surprised by how delicious it is. This recipe hails from Sinaloa, a coastal state on the western side of Mexico that is known for its seafood. In this Aguachile recipe, fresh shrimp is marinated in a blend of chiles and lime. Just like ceviche, the lime ""cooks"" the shrimp while it marinates. Cool, crunchy cucumber and red onion are classic garnishes.', ""No, these Swiss enchiladas weren't invented in Europe. They originated at the Sanborn's Café in Mexico City in 1950. This recipe uses a creamy tomatillo sauce and lots of cheese. All that dairy gave the restaurant the idea to give the dish a Swiss inspiration.

Tamales are usually wrapped in dried corn husks that have been soaked in water to make them soft and pliable. Occasionally, people will use fresh corn husks or banana leaves to wrap their tamales.', ""Dough. Tamale dough is a mixture of masa, lard, and salt. Fresh masa is dried corn that has been cooked in limewater, soaked overnight, and then ground up while still wet. This makes the lightest, fluffiest tamales. If fresh masa isn't available, you can use masa harina, flour made from dried masa. Masa harina just needs to have extra liquid added to it."", 'Filling. The most well-known tamale recipes have a filling of braised pork or beef in a complex sauce of spices and dried and fresh chiles. Tamales can also be stuffed with chicken, vegetables, cheese, beans, seafood, or even fruit and nuts.', 'Building a Better Tamale', ""For light and fluffy tamale dough, whip the lard and salt with electric beaters for a few minutes before adding the masa. Once you add the masa, continue to whip, adding water or meat broth until the mixture is the consistency of soft cookie dough. Test it by dropping a small ball of dough into a glass of water. If the dough sinks, it needs more liquid whipped into it; if it floats, it's ready to use. If you prefer not to cook with lard, substitute an equal amount of vegetable shortening, although the dough will not have the same fullness of flavor."", 'To assemble:', 'Have fun! Making tamales can easily turn into an all-day affair, which is why Mexican families reserve them as a treat for very special occasions.

The state of Oaxaca is located in the south of the country and boasts incredible geographic diversity with mountain ranges, canyons, valleys, rivers, and coastline along the Pacific with nine major bays. These varying climates afford Oaxacan cuisine a wealth of various ingredients: seafood from coastal areas, vegetables from the Central Valley region, and tropical fruits from the northeast near Veracruz. And because of the area\'s rich history and isolated terrain, Oaxaca has preserved and officially recognized 16 indigenous cultures, each with unique culinary traditions that enrich Oaxaca\'s striking culinary landscape. This is nowhere more evident than in the region\'s iconic mole sauce, of which there are officially seven types—but every Abuela, or ""grandmother,"" has her own special family recipe, carried down through generations.', ""But before we dive into the wonders of mole sauce, let's explore the key ingredients in Oaxacan cuisine and the most famous dishes made with them."", ""As with all of Mexico for thousands of years, corn is Oaxaca's staple ingredient. It is most often dried and ground into a masa dough, featured in the region's beloved tamales or used to make tortillas, which are incorporated into almost every meal—whether as a vessel for meat and vegetables or as a side dish for dipping into rich savory sauces or soups."", ""Oaxacan cooking favors a variety of mainly black beans, most often prepared with aniseed and served as a topping or a black-bean-style soup. It's most notably used on tlayuda, which is almost like an Oaxacan pizza (more on that below)."", ""Oaxacan chile peppers are renowned by chefs and highly prized for their one-of-a-kind flavor profile. They are traditionally smoke-dried in a slow process that brings out each pepper variety's unique piquancy. These dried chile peppers are one of the most important ingredients in mole sauces."", ""Chocolate is grown throughout Oaxaca and is used in the region's famous mole negro, but it's the region's ubiquitous hot chocolate beverage that the ingredient is best known for. For this delicious drink, the cacao beans are hand-ground, then mixed with hot milk, sugar, almonds, cinnamon and other warming spices."", 'Also known as quesillo, Oaxacan cheese is similar to mozzarella, but a bit softer and presented in ropes like string cheese. Cooks and street vendors rip off rough strips of the soft cheese and sprinkle them on a number of dishes like quesadillas.', 'Oaxacan cuisine features a number of edible insects, but the most popular is, by far, its grasshoppers, or chapulines. They are toasted to crunchy perfection in a comal, or earthenware griddle, over hot coals, then seasoned with garlic, lime juice, and salt. They are eaten by themselves as snacks, as a filling for tacos and the like, or as a salty crunchy topping.', 'Huitlacoche, or corn fungus, is a noteworthy Oaxacan delicacy. Also known as ""Mexico\'s truffle,"" the strange-looking fungus has a mushroom-like earthiness and slight sweetness that is so lovely, it commands top dollar—or top peso. Next time you\'re in Oaxaca and you see huitlacoche as a taco or empanada filling, don\'t shy away from the opportunity to taste this special ingredient. Here it fills crispy quesadillas.', 'There are seven distinct types of mole: negro (black), amarillo (yellow), coloradito (little red), mancha manteles (""tablecloth-stainer""), chichilo (named after the sauce\'s main chile pepper), rojo (red), and verde (green). Many would argue that the mole negro is Oaxaca\'s finest mole. It consists of smoke-dried chile peppers charred on a comal over hot coals, almonds, pecans, tomatoes, tomatillos, white onion, garlic, plantain, peppercorns, cloves, cinnamon, biscuit-like cookies, a chocolate bread, raisins, prunes, oregano herb mixture, and chocolate, among other things. The labor- and time-intensive sauce is usually served over fall-off-the-bone chicken, pork, or beef and alongside any combination of rice, tortilla, salsas, and sometimes topped with crunchy grasshoppers. But the sauce—a tantalizing mix of smoky char, piquant heat, sweet chocolate and fruit notes, earthy spices, and salty goodness—is definitely the star of the show.', 'Try this Authentic Mole Sauce or the verde mole in this Pollo Oaxaca dish.', ""Across Mexico, tamales are a beloved treat enjoyed morning, noon, and night in both savory and sweet iterations. Normally, the pillowy masa dough is stuffed with any combo of stewed meats, cheeses, vegetables, fruit, or chocolate, then steamed in a corn husk.
