That\'s not where I got the idea to share this amazing Moroccan harira, but if I did a list called, ""The Best Soups You\'re Not Eating,"" this would be at the top.', ""I added some cubed up lamb shoulder to mine, which works wonderfully well with the other flavors here, but the combination of the lentils and chickpeas, along with the starchy goodness of the pasta makes for a very hearty, satisfying soup, whether you use meat or not. Besides going full plant-based, I've heard beef or chicken are also great choices, so as usual, feel free to play around with the ingredient list."", ""Sadly, I've never been to Morocco, but I'm told this is the national soup, and once you taste it, it's not hard to understand why. Like all great soups, this warms the body, and comforts the soul, but there's something else happening I can't quite put my finger on. Maybe it's the silkiness from the slurry, or the warming, aromatic spices, but whatever is going on produces a truly unique soup that simply can't be missed, and I really do hope you give it a try soon. Enjoy!"", 'Heat olive oil in a stock pot over medium-high heat and cook cubed lamb until nicely browned and some of the fat has rendered, about 5 minutes.', 'Toss in diced onion and a generous pinch of salt.

The villagers, wary of the traveler and suspicious of his sudden appearance, refused to give him any food.', 'The man, unfazed by this display of stinginess, smiled politely at the unfriendly villagers before setting up camp near a local stream. Once he was situated, he wordlessly filled his pot with water, placed it over a fire, then dropped a stone into his makeshift ""soup.""', 'Village members couldn\'t help but ask the traveler what he was creating over the fire. ""I\'m making stone soup,"" he replied. ""It\'s delicious. I\'ll be glad to share it with all of you when I\'m finished — I just need to find a few more ingredients."" One by one, the villagers added ingredients from their individual homes, making a rich vegetable soup worth sharing.', 'Of course, the story exists to teach a lesson: Sharing, a necessary part of life, makes everything better. However, a dish called ""stone soup"" that uses the elements really does exist in Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'The Chinantec people used the rocky Mexican terrain to their advantage during the Pre-Ceramic period, according to Culinary Backstreets.

The bread is then served warm either with a topping spooned over or with a topping on the side so each person can build their own bruschetta.

Rub on a little more garlic for a stronger flavor, if you wish. But watch out: A little garlic goes a long way.· Be patient: Make the tomato mixture and let it sit for a couple of hours so the flavors can develop more complexity. Yes, the tomatoes may give off a lot of juice as they marinate, but if you think the mixture is too juicy come serving time, simply use a slotted spoon to lift out the bruschetta topping as you spoon it over the bread. Don't toss the liquid, though — lots of people love to dip into it with extra bread.

Well, here's how you can easily combine the healthful eating guidelines of the Mediterranean diet with the time-saving convenience of a multi-cooker. To get you started, I'll share a quick overview of the Mediterranean diet plus easy recipes you can make in your Instant Pot or pressure cooker."", ""What is the Mediterranean diet? This popular healthy eating plan emphasizes whole foods, fresh vegetables and fruits, whole grains, healthy fats such as olive oil and avocado, and proteins such as chicken, seafood, nuts, beans, and legumes. In addition, you'll cut back on added sugars and processed foods, and eat dairy in moderation. You'll also cut back on added salt by using fresh and dried herbs to flavor your food instead."", ""What are the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet? According to the Mayo Clinic, following this eating style can result in a longer life expectancy and lower rates of chronic diseases. In fact, it's been consistently ranked among the best diets overall."", 'Do I have to eat only Mediterranean food on the Mediterranean diet? Not at all. There are many international cuisines that happen to fall within the guidelines, including Asian and Mexican food. Just be sure you make healthy ingredient choices, such as chicken or seafood instead of pork or red meat, olive oil instead of coconut oil or lard, low-sodium broths, and more herbs instead of added salt.', '""I\'ve made this recipe twice in the last month and we just love it! The Instant Pot makes it so easy.

And who can take the credit?', ""A likely case comes from Dallas oil executive Everette Lee DeGolyer, a chili connoisseur who became a historian in his later years. DeGolyer's findings suggest that chili became popular campfire fare among cowboys on the cattle trail (most of whom were Mexican) and gold-seekers (called forty-niners) on their way to California. As evidence, DeGolyer points to a journal from a forty-niner, dated from 1849 to 1850:"", 'In short, beef, fat, chile peppers, and seasoning were combined into blocks, dubbed ""chili bricks,"" which were stored in saddlebags. Plunging part of a chili block into a pot of boiling water transformed it into a convenient, filling meal.', ""Others suggest that a group of women first concocted the dish: the lavanderas (washerwomen) who traveled through Texas with the Mexican Army in the 1830s and '40s, washing clothes and cooking for the soldiers. It's said their large washing pots doubled as cooking pots to stew venison or goat with chile peppers."", ""Another theory credits a small population of immigrants from the Canary Islands, then a territory of Spain, who Spanish colonists brought to San Antonio in 1731 to counter France from spreading its territory west of Louisiana. Chili resembles Canarian cooking in its use of dried cumin, and it's said Canarian women in Texas were known for cooking a spicy stew."", ""Regardless of how chili first came to be, one group popularized it as a San Antonio staple. Mexican women known as the Chili Queens cooked and sold chili at San Antonio's Military Plaza as early as the 1860s, Texas historian Robb Walsh says. Soldiers, travelers, cattlemen, and others congregated at the plaza for the dish, the granddaughter of one of the last Chili Queens told NPR. Customers often ordered chili with tamales or with beans and a tortilla."", 'Outdoor chili stands remained fixtures of San Antonio through the 1930s, when the local government began shutting them down, citing sanitary reasons. The last chili stands closed in the early 1940s.', ""A San Antonio chili stand at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair introduced many to the Texas-born dish. Soon, chili parlors began cropping up all over the Midwest and elsewhere in the United States. For example, the first written mention of chili in Oklahoma dates to 1897, and recipes for the dish appeared in community cookbooks in 1903 and 1905, according to the Oklahoma Historical Society."", 'Over the following decades, regional variations of chili developed. In 1922, Macedonian immigrants opened Empress Chili in Cincinnati. They drew inspiration from the chili parlors Americans were familiar with to sell a Mediterranean-style stew over spaghetti. Empress Chili put Cincinnati on the map as another chili destination.', ""Other Midwestern takes include Indiana's Hoosier Chili, Oklahoma Chili, Illinois's Springfield Chili, and Missouri's Kansas City Chili."", 'Unlike ""Texas red"" chili, New Mexico\'s version uses the Hatch chile, grown in the town of Hatch, and gets the name chile verde (green chili) from this key ingredient. Though chili and chile verde share similarities, the dishes developed apart from each other. Chile verde hails from northern Mexico, and it consists of pork chunks, green chilis, onions, and tomatillos.', 'The International Chili Society, which holds the World Championship Chili Cook-off, divides chili into the following categories: traditional red, chili verde, homestyle chili, and veggie chili.', ""As purists would have it, traditional red (chili con carne) hasn't changed much over the years. It still consists of meat, red chili peppers, and spices—no beans, rice, pasta, or other fillers, aside from vegetables, according to ICS criteria.""]"

Here are some of the key ingredients you'll find in the Chinese kitchen."", ""Soy sauce: An incredibly versatile ingredient in Chinese cooking, soy sauce is used to flavor sauces, stews, marinades and meat, fish and vegetable dishes. Chinese soy sauce is generally saltier and not as sweet as Japanese. Try it in General Tsao's Chicken II."", 'Plum sauce: A traditional sauce for duck and pork recipes, plum sauce is a thick, sweet-and-sour sauce. It is made with plums, apricots and seasonings and sometimes goes by the name ""duck sauce."" Make your own Plum Sauce. And try it with Peking Duck.', 'Black bean sauce: A sauce made from fermented soybeans, ginger and orange peel. Try it in Chicken with Green Peppers in Black Bean Sauce.', ""Hoisin sauce: Sweet and spicy, hoisin sauce is primarily a table condiment made with soybeans (or wheat), garlic, chile pepper, and other spices. It is almost jam-like in consistency and is frequently used to flavor meat, poultry and seafood dishes. Try it in Chinese Barbeque Pork (Char Siu) or On Luck's Hoisin Pepper Steak Stir-Fry."", 'Peanut oil: A flavorful oil with a high smoking point excellent for stir-frying. Chinese peanut oil has a pronounced peanut flavor often missing in American versions. Try it in Hong Kong Sweet and Sour Pork.', 'Sesame oil: Dark and flavorful, sesame oil accentuates many Chinese dishes and is meant to be used sparingly. Store sesame oil in a cool, dry place. Try it with Chinese Pork Dumplings.', ""Rice wine: Somewhat sweet and low in alcohol, rice wine is made from fermenting steamed glutinous rice. Try it in Lion's Head Meatballs."", 'Chinese red and black vinegars: If you cannot find these vinegars, try substituting balsamic vinegar. Try Chinese black vinegar in Sichuan Cucumber Salad or Taiwanese Fried Tofu.', 'Chili paste: An important ingredient in Chinese cooking, chili paste is made from fermented fava beans, red chiles, flour, and garlic. Try it in Spicy Crispy Beef or Chongqing Chicken.', 'Five-spice powder: A pungent mix of Szechuan peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, fennel seed, and star anise, five-spice powder is used extensively in Chinese cooking. It is not always limited to just five ingredients, however. Try it in Grilled Five Spice Chicken.', ""Sesame seeds: Mild and nut-like, sesame seeds are used to add texture and flavor to a variety of Chinese dishes. Their flavor intensifies when toasted. Try it with Beef and Riced Broccoli Bowl or Chef John's Shrimp Toast."", 'Ginger: Spicy, pungent, peppery and somewhat sweet, fresh ginger adds big flavor to Chinese dishes, whether grated, ground, slivered or minced. Try it in Steamed Fish with Ginger.', 'Pork: The most important meat in Chinese cooking, pork is highly versatile, found in everything from dumplings to soups, stir-fries to spare ribs. Try these Chinese Pork Recipes.', 'Tofu: A versatile ingredient, tofu is enjoyed in stir-fries, soups, casseroles, salads, sauces, and sandwiches. It is high in protein and an excellent meat substitute. Tofu is made by pressing curdled soy milk in a process similar to cheese making. Smooth and creamy, the firmness of tofu varies. Tofu is perishable and should be refrigerated and eaten within a week of purchase. Try it in Vegan Mapo Tofu.', 'Rice: One of the most important ingredients in Chinese cuisine, particularly in the south, rice is indigenous to China and has been cultivated there for thousands of years. Many kinds of rice are used in Chinese cooking of various sizes, shapes, and colors. Rice goes with so many Chinese Main Dishes.', 'Wonton or spring roll wrappers: Look for these paper-thin sheets prepackaged in many supermarkets. Try it in Pork Dumplings.', 'Straw mushrooms: Grown on straw, these tiny mushrooms are earthy and musty. They are usually available in the United States in cans, though they can be found fresh in some specialty stores. Try it in Moo Goo Gai Pan.', 'Bean sprouts: The sprouts that spring forth from mung beans are the most popular in Chinese cooking, adding a crisp, earthy element to many dishes. They are quite perishable and should be stored refrigerated in a plastic bag or covered in water in the refrigerator. Best eaten raw, bean sprouts also do well in stir-fries after very brief cooking. Try them with Egg Foo Yung with Mushroom Sauce or Chicken Jook with Lots of Vegetables.', 'Shallots: Part of the onion family, shallots look more like garlic. Milder than an onion, shallots are used like onions in Chinese cooking. Dry shallots will keep in a cool, dry place for about a month. Try them in Chinese Steamed Buns with BBQ Pork Filling.', ""Bok choy: Actually a very small cabbage, bok choy's leaves are tender and mild; its stalk is crunchy. Boy choy is used in soups, salads, stir-fries, and cooked vegetables.

Try it in Chef John's Chinese Scallion Pancakes."", 'Red chiles: The Portuguese brought chile peppers to China following the age of exploration in the Americas. Today, they are an indispensable ingredient in spicy Szechuan cuisine. Try it in Quick Szechwan Sauce or Hunan Kung Pao.', ""Garlic: A member of the lily family (along with leeks, chives, onions and shallots), garlic is the strongest-flavored, most assertive member of the group. Look for firm dry heads of garlic. Store them whole and unbroken in a cool, dry, dark location. They'll stay for about two months. To peel garlic, place the clove under the flat side of a chef's knife and gently press down with the ball of your hand, lightly crushing the clove. The skin will split, allowing you to pull it off the clove more easily. Try it in Chinese Take-Out Shrimp with Garlic."", 'Cilantro: A member of the parsley family (also known as Chinese parsley), cilantro has a distinctive green, waxy flavor. Cilantro is the usual name for the leaf of the plant otherwise known as coriander, and from which coriander seed is obtained. Try it in Fried Rice with Cilantro.', 'Cabbages: There are many kinds of cabbage sold in Chinese markets. One of the more familiar in the United States is the Napa cabbage, a light-flavored vegetable with very pale green leaves. A very popular addition to stir-fries. Try it in Black Pepper Beef and Cabbage Stir Fry.', 'Check out our collection of Chinese Recipes.']"

As foreigners took away spices, they also contributed to India's cuisine. The Chinese brought rice and the wok; the Portuguese introduced vinegar, tomatoes, potatoes, and chilies. Persian, Mongolian and Indonesian influences were also significant. Here are key ingredients to stock in your pantry for delicious DIY Indian recipes."", 'Cardamom: An important spice in garam masala, cardamom has a grapefruit-like, floral, soapy flavor containing some green/woody notes. It has a menthol undertone and is similar to ginger. It is used as whole pods, as seeds, and ground. Try it in Easy Vegetarian Kofta Curry.', 'Cinnamon: Cinnamon is characteristically woody, musty and earthy in flavor and aroma and is warming to taste. The finer the grind, the more quickly the cinnamon is perceived by the taste buds. Whole cinnamon sticks are often infused in sauces and rice. Unlike in the West, where cinnamon is associated with sweet baked goods, in India it is a savory spice that is also used in meat dishes. Try it in Curry Stand Chicken Tikka Masala Sauce.', 'Cilantro/Coriander: The flavor and aroma of cilantro (fresh coriander) is generally described as being waxy, citrus, and soapy. The flavor of the leaf is distinctive, and quite different from that of the coriander seed. Cilantro is used as a garnish, in seasoning blends, and in sauces such as masala and curry. Ground coriander is an important ingredient in curry powders and garam masala. Its flavor is described as being minty, sweet and citrus-like.', 'Cloves: The flavor of cloves is strong, pungent, sweet--almost hot. They are one of the most penetrating of all spices and their bitter, astringent flavor leaves a numbing sensation in the mouth. Cloves are an important ingredient in the spice blends of Sri Lanka and North India. They are used in garam masala, biryanis, and pickles.', 'Cumin: An important ingredient in garam masala and curry powder, cumin is characterized by a strong musty, earthy flavor which also contains some green/grassy notes. Both whole seeds and ground cumin are used in cooking. Try it in Indian Butter Chicken (Chicken Makhani).', 'Listen to Allrecipes ""Homemade"" podcast to hear Aarti Sequeria\'s essential Indian spices and more!', 'Fenugreek: Rich and round with a slight bite, this aromatic plant is known for its pleasantly bitter, slightly sweet seeds. Fenugreek seeds, which come whole and ground, are used to flavor many foods, including curry powders, spice blends and teas. Fenugreek seeds should be stored in a cool, dark place for no more than 6 months. Try it in Dal Makhani (Indian Lentils).', 'Garam masala: Garam is the Hindi word for ""warm"" or ""hot,"" and this blend of dry-roasted ground spices from the colder climes of northern India adds a sense of warmth to both palate and spirit. There are as many variations of garam masala (which may contain up to 12 spices) as there are Indian cooks. It can include black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, cumin, cardamom, dried chiles, fennel, ginger, mace and nutmeg. Garam masala is usually either added to a curries, vegetable dishes, soups, or stews toward the end of cooking or sprinkled over the surface just before serving. Check out 10 Amazing Indian Recipes to Make with Garam Masala.', 'Mint: Often paired with lamb dishes and served in raitas and chutneys, this cooling herb has a pleasantly fresh, aromatic, sweet flavor. Try it in Indian Style Sheekh Kabab.', 'Tamarind: Also called Indian date, concentrated tamarind pulp is used to add a somewhat sour flavor to chutneys and curries. Limes are an acceptable substitute. Try it in Lamb Shank Vindaloo.', 'Turmeric: This ground dried root has a characteristic musky, earthy aroma and a pungent, slightly bitter flavor. Turmeric is a powerful yellow-orange coloring agent, used as a dye for fabrics and foods such as pickles, relish, and chutneys, plus rice, lentil, and vegetable dishes. Turmeric is thought to aid the digestion and to work as an anti-inflammatory agent. Try it in Super Easy Oven-Roasted Okra.', 'Additional spices: Indian food is so rich with spices that what we have above is only a partial list. For a well-stocked pantry, you might consider stocking up on peppercorns (the source of ""heat"" in spicy foods before the introduction of chiles), fennel seeds, poppy seeds, bay leaves, black mustard seeds, nigella seeds (kalonji--sometimes called black onion seed), saffron, and asafoetida.', 'Chiles: Indigenous to America, chiles were introduced into India by the Portuguese. They are essential ingredients in making vindaloo curries (itself a perversion of a Portuguese word vindalho, which combines the words ""vinho,"" for vinegar, and ""aldos,"" for garlic.) Indian cuisine makes use of both fresh chiles (whole, minced, or made into a paste) and dried chiles. If a recipe calls for chile powder, use ground cayenne pepper — do not use a spice blend. Try cayenne in Jonagold\'s Chicken Vindaloo.', 'Coconuts: The milk and oil from coconuts are important particularly in Southern Indian cooking where it is popular in curries. Grated coconut is often used in desserts or added to sauces. Try coconut milk in Mango Coconut Sauce.', 'Tomatoes: As with chiles, tomatoes were brought to India by the seafaring Portuguese. They are an important component in curries, vegetable dishes, and chutneys. Try crushed whole tomatoes in Indian Tomato Chicken.', 'Garlic: Garlic, ginger, and green chiles are an important flavor trilogy in Indian cuisine, sautéed in oil or ghee as a first step in many recipes. Try garlic (along with ginger and green chiles) in Spicy Indian Chicken with Green Masala.', 'Ginger: The edible part of the ""ginger root"" is actually part of the underground portion of the plant\'s stem, not the root. Often used in paste form, ginger adds strong fragrance, flavor, and bite to curries and other dishes. Try minced fresh ginger in Potatoes with Fresh Ginger and Chilies.', ""Mangos: One of India's most important fruits, mangoes come in dozens of varieties. They're eaten fresh and used in drinks, chutneys, and pickles. Try sliced mango in Indian Hot Curried Mangos with Tofu."", ""Fresh Vegetables: Indian cooks have created one of the world's most vegetable-friendly cuisines. If you're interested in eating more vegetarian foods, Indian cuisine is a great place to start. Among the most popular vegetables are potatoes, spinach, cauliflower, onions, peas, and eggplant. Check out our collection of Vegetarian Indian Main Dishes."", 'Basmati rice: The name means ""queen of fragrance."" This long-grained, fine-textured rice has been grown in the foothills of the Himalayas for centuries. The rice is used in biryanis and other special-occasion rice dishes. Try this recipe for Indian Style Basmati Rice.', 'Lentils: Because many Indian religious practices limit or forbid the eating of meat, Indian cuisine abounds with lentil dishes (a fine source of protein), including stuffed samosas, soups, stews, and breads. Lentils are ""pulses,"" and they come in many eye-catching colors. Hulled red lentils are common; they are smaller and faster-cooking than brown lentils — for best flavor, do not substitute brown lentils.', 'Garbanzo beans: Also called chickpeas, garbanzo beans are available canned, dried and sometimes fresh. Dried garbanzo beans are also ground into flour. Try canned chickpeas in Indian Kale with Chickpeas. and dried chickpeas in Crunchy Spiced Chickpeas.', 'Flour: Breads can be eaten in place of rice in many parts of India: grilled breads such as naan, griddled breads such as chapati and roti, and the crepe-like dosa. Fried breads such as samosas, pappadam, and paratha are served as appetizers and snacks and as desserts. Check out our collection of Indian Breads.', 'Dairy products are relatively rare in Indian cuisine, due to their short shelf-life in the warm climate and a historical lack of refrigeration. By processing dairy foods (culturing yogurt, clarifying butter, cooking milk to make sweets), Indian cooks made them more available.', 'Yogurt: Yogurt is often spiced and served as a condiment (raitas), used in place of coconut milk in curries, or prepared as a sweet or salty beverage (lassi).', 'Paneer: Indian cuisine is not big on cheese. But paneer is a notable exception. A non-melting fresh cheese, paneer is similar to queso blanco (a good substitute) or fresh mozzarella. Paneer is a vegetarian cheese, meaning that there is no rennet added. Make your own Homemade Paneer and try it in Palak Paneer Curry.', 'Ghee: A type of clarified butter that is particularly popular in Northern Indian cuisine, ghee has a brown color and rich, nutty flavor. Butter is simmered until all the moisture separates from the fat and the milk solids sink to the bottom of the pan, so they can be skimmed off. Ghee has benefits over whole butter in that it has a significantly higher smoke point and a longer shelf life. See Clarifying Butter for step-by-step instructions.', 'Check out our complete collection of Indian Recipes.', '']"

Not too thick or coarse, panko crumbs are flaky, light, and airy, so they create a delicate but crispy coating on just about anything that needs a little crunch — from chicken tenders to breaded veggies and baked casseroles. You can also use panko in place of breadcrumbs to help bind meatballs, tuna or rice cakes, meatloaves, and veggie burgers. Here are some favorite recipes that showcase ways to put your panko to delicious use.', 'Let\'s start with a classic. Tonkatsu is the traditional Japanese boneless, breaded pork chop. ""A wonderful, easy recipe, yet special,"" says Trish. ""I love another use for panko crumbs.""', 'Crispy outside, moist and tender inside with a surprise garlic-butter center, this elegant chicken recipe can\'t fail to impress.

It was a great easy recipe full of flavor! I sprinkled a little Parmesan cheese on top. Yum!""', 'Panko crumbs also make the best Scotch eggs. ""In my version of Scotch eggs, I keep the egg soft, so when you bite in, you get that amazing contrast in texture between the molten yolk and the crispy sausage shell,"" says Chef John.', ""Panko makes a great topping for almost any casserole that you'd top with breadcrumbs or potato chips. Here's a semi-fancy, adult-friendly mac-and-cheese that proves the point."", '""I love Asian-style fish or shrimp cakes but almost never order them because I find there\'s too much filler or \'binder,\'"" says Chef John.

With this recipe, you\'ll season fresh shrimp with garlic powder, and then triple dip: first into a beaten egg mixture, then into a flour and paprika combo, and finally into panko crumbs.

""The panko makes all the difference.""', 'What happens when a simple country chicken heads to the big city? It becomes pork! Yes, this breaded-and-fried meat-on-a-stick isn\'t chicken at all, it\'s chopped pork tenderloin (or pork shoulder).

""I love the simple combination of really good ricotta and fresh herbs baked with just enough eggs to hold things together,"" says Chef John.', 'You\'ll also want panko for lightly breaded appetizers like jalapeño poppers and stuffed mushrooms. ""These poppers were very good,"" says monica. ""Made these with the over-abundance of jalapeño peppers from my garden. I combined the two cheeses and used a Mexican cheese blend then sprinkled panko crumbs on top.""', 'The light flake of panko breadcrumbs also makes them essential for onion rings.

And if you\'re more into waffling than totting, they make tasty savory waffles, too.', 'Here\'s one for the end of summer when ripe tomatoes are in perfect peak form. You\'ll spread a mixture of Parmesan cheese, Panko crumbs, feta cheese, and parsley over puff pastry, then add a layer of sautéed onions and garlic, followed by a tomato layer. Garnish your galette with a sprinkle of fresh basil. ""A light and savory meal to use up all of those tomatoes from the garden,"" says tcasa.', 'A little panko gives these ground pork meatballs great texture. Cooked under the broiler and served with a lively dipping sauce, these Vietnamese-inspired meatballs offer an enticing balance of spicy, salty, tangy, and sweet flavors.

Here's how to do it."", 'Start, if you can, with larger chicken wings. Smaller wings can sometimes overcook when using a double-fry method. Separate the flats from the drumettes; discard the tips or save them for stock. Season the wings well with salt and pepper, and if you like, some minced ginger.

You'll need about 1/3-1/2 cup starch per pound of wings."", 'Coat the wings thoroughly, pressing the starch into the surface with a squeeze, and then tapping lightly to remove any excess. Arrange the coated wings on a rack over a sheet pan so that they stay dry.', ""While you may not have heard of double-frying—where a lower-heat oil blanching begins to cook the interior, then a second fry at a higher temp gives that perfect crisp and wonderful browning—you've eaten plenty of delicious foods cooked that way. For example, if you've munched on crispy frites with steak at a French bistro, you've experienced the wonder of double frying."", ""Here's how to double-fry chicken wings: Pour a quart of high-smoke point oil like peanut, avocado, or grapeseed into a countertop deep fryer or a heavy-bottomed pot with deep sides."", 'For your first fry, have your oil around 325° F. Fry the wings in batches for about 10-12 minutes until they are crisp, but blond, without much browning. Set the wings aside and increase the heat of your oil to 350°. Fry again until the exteriors are deeply browned and extra crunchy, and the interiors register at least 185°F on a meat thermometer.

Kimchi harnesses that power to create a uniquely spicy, salty, and satisfying condiment that enhances every dish it touches. Learn more about this Korean staple and the endless ways to use it."", ""Kimchi is a Korean fermented vegetable condiment, usually with a base of some type of cabbage. It's often flavored with various types of chilis or chili pastes, but the most common is a Korean red pepper flake called Gochugaru. Other flavor boosters like fish sauce or dried shrimp are often added as well as aromatics like ginger or garlic."", 'Kimchi can also be made with several types of radishes or other leafy vegetables like bok choy. There are many different types and recipes for kimchi, nearly as many recipes as families making it. Regional traditions combined with geographically available ingredients can shape recipes as well.', 'Kimchi can include many different combinations of ingredients, but generally, the method of getting from raw ingredients to a delicious jar of kimchi is the same. Like many fermented foods, kimchi starts with a salt brine. This is insurance against any harmful bacteria and ensures delicious fermentation and not spoilage. Then, just the good bacteria is left behind.', 'This type of bacteria feeds on sugar; the by-product is lactic acid, the same type of acid that gives yogurt its tang. A spice paste is added and massaged into the veggies and once everything is combined, the kimchi is firmly packed into jars. The lactic acid goes to work, partially breaking down the veggies and working on those delicious flavors.', ""Some choose to leave their kimchi for just a few days, while others leave it for much longer to heighten its sour flavor.One of the significant benefits of making kimchi at home is you can totally control the flavors to suit your preferences. Like your kimchi spicy? Up the chili paste. Cooking for vegetarians? Omit the fish sauce. Have some extra carrots kicking around? Add 'em in!"", ""There are more than 100 different varieties of kimchi out there, so finding a recipe tailored to your preferences is easy. If you're looking to start experimenting with making kimchi at home, a basic recipe with room for tweaks is a great place to start."", ""If you've never tried kimchi before but are a fan of any type of pickled or fermented foods, you'll probably love kimchi's funky tang. Some kimchi is spicy, while others are milder. In general, it has a distinct fermented flavor that plays well with all types of ingredients, especially rich, fatty flavors and salty items."", 'Depending on what veggies are used, the texture can be crunchy from radishes or daikon, or lightly crisp in the case of cabbage. If you happen to see a few types of kimchi at the store, snag a couple of different varieties and try them out to see which ones you like best. It never hurts to have a few different types on hand for different dishes.', 'Kimchi is a Korean dish, and many Koreans eat it every day, even multiple times per day. It goes well on the side of your favorite Korean dishes, especially things like pork belly or Bibimbap. Savory kimchi pancakes are a quick way to keep kimchi the star of the dish and are great at any time of day, especially when dunked in a salty dipping sauce or drizzled with spicy mayo.', 'Get the recipe: Corned Beef Kimchi Fried Rice', ""Kimchi can also jazz up an otherwise boring grilled cheese — just add a hefty scoop into your sandwich with some nice cheddar, it's a classic combo that brings a comfort food staple to a whole new level. If you're new to the wonderful world of kimchi cookery, a great way to try it out is simply mounded atop a steaming scoop of rice, crowned with a crispy fried egg. Once you've tried that, take the plunge into kimchi fried rice. You won't regret it."", 'Depending on where you live, you might be able to find at least one brand of kimchi in your local grocery store. The shelf-stable kind can usually be found in the international section or possibly with the pickled items. Some varieties of kimchi are not canned and sealed and are sold fresh, usually in the produce section near the tofu.', ""If you have a Korean or Asian supermarket in your community, patronize it. They'll generally have many different varieties, and you'll have lots more to choose from. They might even have locally made brands or unique varieties that you can't get anywhere else; it's more than worth the trip."", ""Some kimchi is sold shelf stable so until it's opened, it can be stored in a cabinet or pantry. If it's homemade or sold fresh, it should be stored in the fridge, any prolonged stint at room temperature could foster harmful bacteria or accelerate spoilage. So long as the liquid is covering the veggies and everything is submerged, your kimchi should stay fresh for months.""]"

Gochujang is one of those condiments. This Korean fermented pepper paste is packed with spice, funk, sweetness, and umami. Fair warning — once you introduce this stuff to your fridge, you won't be able to function without it. And you might be taking it down by the spoonful. Don't say you weren't warned."", ""This brick red, Korean condiment is made from peppers, glutinous (sticky) rice, fermented soy beans, aromatics (garlic, onions, sesame), sweeteners (syrups or sugar), and salt. It is a product of fermentation (like sauerkraut and kimchi), so it's got that quintessential funky flavor note. Depending on the kind of peppers that the paste is made of and the amount that's used will determine how spicy the gochujang is — if you prefer a less spice, you can opt for a mild gochujang. Because of the fermentation, the paste has a subtle sweetness, which is a nice counterbalance to the spiciness and salty, umami flavor."", ""Gochujang varies in its level of heat. Because all versions are a little different, it depends on the amount of red chili flakes that were used to make that particular brand or batch. If you're sensitive to spice, look for a mild gochujang, and don't be afraid to try several brands in order to see which one fits your taste best. You'd be surprised how the sweetness and funkiness of the rest of the condiment can cut through the heat. And hey, for any of the contenders that proved too hot for your palate, gift those containers to a couple of friends — might as well spread the gochujang love."", ""If you're ready to pull the trigger and try out this magical paste, you can buy some online, at Korean grocery stores, and some well-stocked grocery stores. Look for brands like Mother in Law's, Bibigo, or One Culture. Sometimes it's packaged in jars or bottles, while some brands are packaged in tubs. Regardless, it will always be in the refrigerated section. Remember, not all gochujang pastes are the same, so you should try out a few brands and decide for yourself which one you like best."", 'Buy It: Gochujang Hot Pepper Paste, 1.1lbs ($17.89, amazon.com)', ""If you'd rather take matters into your own hands and make gochujang right at home, you definitely can. Grab a recipe like this five-star Gochujang Sauce — you'll need gochugaru (Korean red chili flakes), sticky rice powder and/or dried soybeans, and some sort of sweetener (like honey, malt syrup, rice syrup or maple syrup). You'll need to heat all of the ingredients before sealing your homemade gochujang up in an airtight container and letting it sit for anywhere from a few days to 6 months. The longer it has to ferment, the more flavorful it will be."", ""Once you've got your hands on this stuff, it's time to put it to good use. This absolute flavor bomb of a condiment can take any marinade, braise, soup, or stew up a giant notch. Frying some chicken wings? Whip up a gochujang sauce with sesame oil, soy sauce, brown sugar, and scallions for an easy, game day app. Or, use this same gochujang sauce and toss it in a cucumber salad. Rub gochujang on potatoes, seafood, or pulled pork. Remember, this stuff has extremely concentrated flavor, so a small spoonful can go a long way."", 'Like miso, another fermented product, gochujang needs to be sealed and refrigerated after opening the package.', ""The good thing about this condiment is that it's going to last you for a while. It can last up to 2 years when properly sealed in a refrigerator.

Bul, meaning ""fire,"" and gogi, meaning ""meat,"" originated in Korea\'s Goguryeo era (the 1st century BCE to the 7th century CE), and once you taste these perfectly caramelized morsels of sweet and savory meat, you\'ll understand why this dish has stood the test of time. The tables at Korean restaurants even feature built-in charcoal or gas grills for guests to enjoy this iconic communal dining experience, combining meat and fire served with rice, lettuce leaves, and sumptuous sides (more on that below) in handmade bites, personalized to delight your own unique taste buds.', ""While you can prepare your Korean barbecue with a variety of meats like pork ribs, brisket, beef tongue, pork belly or chicken, the definitive version is beef bulgogi. Ribeye, sirloin, or tenderloin are the recommended cuts, but if you're cooking on a budget, try flank steak or skirt steak with a few extra hours of marinating time. Look for a hunk of meat with nice consistent marbling throughout. This beautiful marbling paired with the mouthwatering marinade is what gives you that melt-in-your-mouth tenderness."", 'Next, you will want to cut the meat, against the grain, into paper-thin slices. Some recipes suggest slicing the beef while frozen for uber-thin uniformity. You can also just have your local butcher pre-slice them for you.', ""An authentic bulgogi marinade combines soy sauce, white or brown sugar, and sesame oil with minced, grated, or blended garlic, onion, and Asian pear. The true authentic Asian pear—a sweet fruit that is more like an apple—is a must. So, head to your local Korean market for the good stuff. Some recipes also call for sweet rice cooking wine, apple juice, or even Coca-Cola for added sweetness. If you want some added depth of flavor, incorporate gochujang, a fermented red chili pepper paste that is ubiquitous in Korean kitchens. The thick, crimson condiment features a sweet, savory, slightly spicy, smoky, funky taste that is to-die-for. It's got a little kick, but if you're looking for even more heat, go with a classic Asian chili garlic sauce. Mix up your marinade, then douse your paper-thin beef slices in the tasty sauce. Let it marinade for at least 2 hours or overnight.Try Chef John's version of Beef Bulgogi, which features a marinade made with Asian pear and Korean chili flakes (gochugaru). Watch Chef John make bulgogi:"", ""Once you're ready to cook, remove the marinated beef and let it come to room temperature—about 30 minutes. The actual barbecuing process hardly takes any time at all. Let the grill, cast-iron skillet, or wok get very hot before searing begins, so that the meat sizzles and caramelizes with crispy brown edges and a tender center. Once you see moisture forming on the top side, flip the slices. It only takes a few minutes—you don't want to cook it too long or it will be dry and tough. If you're looking for a juicier result with a sauce-like effect, you can pour all of the marinated beef and its juices into a skillet or wok. Some prefer this so that the savory-sweet sauce can flavor their rice. Common garnishes include chopped scallions and toasted sesame seeds."", ""Bulgogi's charm lies not only in its incredible flavor, but also in the hands-on, communal experience with handmade bites that can be tailored to dazzle each diner's palate."", 'Just picture it: To start this iconic meal, an authentic Korean table is laden with an assortment of small side dishes known as banchan, which are meant to be enjoyed as appetizers and complements for the barbecue bites throughout the meal. There are hundreds of different types of banchan—spicy cucumber salad, seasoned egg in soy sauce, stir-fried spicy fish cake, dried seaweed, candied sweet potatoes, enoki mushroom pancakes, pickled jalapeno-radish, stir-fried anchovies, seasoned mung bean sprouts, stir-fried zucchini, steamed eggplant, or seasoned greens like spinach, cabbage, or watercress, to name a few.', ""The thinly sliced raw marinated beef is brought to cook on the table's center grill before everyone's eyes. If you want to create this authentic Korean restaurant experience in your own home, get a portable Korean BBQ grill for your home table, and cook the raw slices of meat for all to enjoy the sizzlin' sounds and tantalizing aromas. Another option for serving is on a sizzling fajita platter—most Korean markets will have multiple options available. The beautifully seared beef is most often paired with steamed white rice, lettuces, and kimchi."", 'Ssam, meaning ""wrapped,"" refers to the Korean culinary method in which rice, meat, or other fillings are wrapped in leafy vegetables. Any combination of lettuces that you love can be used to form your lettuce wraps. Popular ones are Koran perilla leaves, red-leaf lettuce, kaenip, Boston lettuce, or steamed or parboiled cabbage. The wrap is meant to be a bite-sized morsel, and everyone has their favored method. Some use multiple lettuce leaves and place a little rice inside with their meat. The addition of kimchi is par for the course. Then any manner of spicy sauces or banchan bites can be added into the mix, as well as ssamjang—a beloved Korean barbecue sauce that is tangy, fermented, and absolutely delightful when paired with the sweet-and-savory beef bulgogi.', 'While ssam is a popular method for eating a bulgogi feast, others prefer to eat their beef atop or mixed into rice, adding in any desired banchan and sauces. And if you want to pair these incredible bulgogi flavors with a beverage, try Korea\'s national drink: soju—a clear rice wine similar to Japan\'s sake. Geonbae! (That\'s ""Cheers!"" in Korean!)', 'Now gather a group of your favorite people and create a bulgogi experience that will truly wow them.', 'Here are some top-rated bulgogi recipes to get you started:']"

With their artfully arranged, colorful, and mouthwatering ingredients, these bowls are so beautiful, they\'ve naturally also taken up a hefty chunk of real estate on social media. But what you might not realize is that the original ""beautiful bowl"" most likely originated in Korea.', 'It\'s called bibimbap (pronounced ""bee-BIM-bop"")—bibim meaning ""mixed"" and bap meaning ""rice."" This beloved Korean bowl incorporates steamed white rice with assorted fresh, marinated, and sautéed vegetables along with raw or seared meat, if desired. It is always served with an egg, most often served sunny-side-up, as well as strips of crunchy and light seasoned seaweed. Kimchi or other fermented veggies, as well as pickled ingredients, lend added depth while the gochujang—Korea\'s iconic fermented red chili pepper paste—imbues the bowls with a smoky, savory, slightly sweet, slightly spicy flavor profile. The tastes and textures are crunchy and luscious, spicy and sweet with pickled and fermented notes.', ""When you see the most gorgeous finished product, you might think bibimbap is too complicated for you, but you'd be wrong. It's been around for centuries and ancient lore has it straddling the highest and lowest echelons of society: Some say it was served to emperors and government officials at lavish parties, while others say that it was a cheap and convenient one-bowl meal that farmers' wives made using seasonal ingredients mixed with rice. Either way, these legends still ring true as bibimbap can be as complicated or as simple as you want it to be."", ""The customizable nature of this dish is an element that cannot be over-celebrated. Bibimbap can be altered to fit any lifestyle or diet—whether that is beginner- or advanced-level cook; adventurous or safe eater, or vegan or ultra-decadent diet. It must be noted, though, that bibimbap by nature is quite healthy with rice and colorful vegetables plus meat, fish, egg, or tofu—providing a low-calorie dish that is high in fiber, carbohydrates, and protein. Because of the dish's flexibility, it is also great for gatherings—a culinary canvas where each eater is also an artist, creating a work of edible art tailored to their own taste buds."", 'To make your own bibimbap at home, you\'ll need short-grain white, or ""sticky,"" rice as your base. Some prefer brown rice, if going for a healthier spin. If you\'re a meat lover, you\'ll need your protein of choice: Traditionally it\'s served with raw beef and raw egg yolks, but if that\'s not your bag, you can substitute with your favorite cooked proteins like seafood, chicken, or over-medium fried egg. Then any variety of your favorite vegetables. In Korea, these are known as banchan and are served at every meal. These small side dishes become integral to the bowl mixture, so do your homework to find the ones that tantalize your own taste buds. The most common bibimbap veggies are lightly seasoned and sautéed julienned carrots, onion, spinach, shiitake mushrooms, and mung bean sprouts, as well as raw lettuces and kimchi.', 'The ""secret sauce"" is quite literally the sauce: gochujang. Different recipes call for different variations and with a little online sleuthing, you can find a recipe befitting your palate. Some use gochujang as is, while others add sesame oil, water, and sugar for a sweeter effect and others add more garlicky, spicy, or vinegary elements.', 'Place the rice in the bottom of the bowl, and arrange the vibrant banchan and protein around the edges, reserving the central spot for the perfectly cooked egg. Drizzle your choices of soy sauce, sesame oil, and gochujang sauce over the base ingredients, and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds if desired.', 'And there is a pretty awesome upgrade to your everyday bibimbap called dolsot bibimbap. Dolsot refers to a ""hot stone pot."" Sesame oil is poured into this hot pot vessel and the rice base is placed atop it, left to sizzle and form a crunchy, toasty crust while the veggies and meats sear and steam above. This decadent version of bibimbap is the more expensive option served in Korean restaurants. And once you taste the sticky rice\'s crunchy, chewy, crispy mutations because of this hot stone—plus the way it makes the veggies and sauces sing—you\'ll understand why.', ""The authentic Korean way to eat bibimbap dictates that you mix everything up—the golden egg yolk; the fresh, fermented, and sauteed vegetables; the raw or seared savory protein of choice; and the soy, sesame, and gochujang sauces. But if you're a military-style eater, feel free to go your own way. After all, that is the beauty of beautiful bibimbap."", 'Check out our complete collection of Korean Recipes.']"

This staple of Korean cooking is used in a wide range of traditional dishes for both its taste and vibrant appearance. Read on to learn why your spice pantry should always include gochugaru.', 'Gochugaru is made from bright red Korean chile peppers with the seeds and membranes removed. They\'re always dried, but look out for the words ""taekyung"" or ""taeyangcho"" on your packages of Korean gochugaru, this denotes the product being specifically sun-dried, which lends itself to being higher-quality and having a better taste. The dried peppers are then blended up, often into large flakes, but they\'re sometimes finely ground into a powder too.', ""Despite its intensely red appearance, gochugaru isn't nearly as spicy as one would expect. It has a subtle heat, but that kick of capsaicin is offset with fruity and sweet notes. Sun-dried varieties of gochugaru feature a mild smokiness, creating an extra depth of flavor."", ""Gochugaru is the backbone of many Korean staples like kimchi, to which it lends a hint of heat and the beloved bright red color, along with gochujang, where it acts as the base for the traditional pepper paste. It's also commonly sprinkled into dishes like soups and stews, such as this dakdoritang or kimchi stew."", ""Gochugaru isn't just reserved to Korean cooking, though. Its unique flavor makes it ideal for sprinkling into marinades for grilled meats, brines for pickled veggies, or even amping up salad dressings. Use it as a milder alternative in recipes that call for red pepper flakes, or as a one-to-one swap in for Aleppo pepper."", ""Gochugaru can be found at any Korean market, with most stores featuring several shelves of different brands, sizes, and heat levels of the pepper powder. This can be overwhelming for most gochugaru newcomers, so we recommend trying a few brands online, then finding your preferred variety. Once you've picked your favorite, you'll be able to easily walk into your local Korean store and shop with confidence. For basic starters, we recommend the Tae-kyung Gochugaru Flakes, or you can opt for the more finely ground Tae-kyung Gochugaru Powder, which is best if you want the flakes to disappear into whatever you're cooking."", 'Related Content:']"

Nonetheless, this staple in Thai cooking can be an incredibly simple way to add tons of bright, powerful flavors to a dish with little to no effort. Here's what you need to know before you add it to your kitchen repertoire."", 'What is curry paste?', 'While curry powder is a blend of dried, ground spices that you can often find between the cumin and dill in the spice aisle at the supermarket, curry paste is like a turbocharged version. It features many of the same spices, such as turmeric, coriander, chili powder, and cumin, then adds in oil, garlic, lemongrass, galangal (or Thai ginger) and some chilies, the latter being the ingredient that gives curry paste its distinct color and flavor.', 'Are there different kinds of curry paste?', ""As far as Thai curry pastes go, there are three main types: red, yellow, and green, all of which start with the same base ingredients. Traditional red curry paste can feature up to 20 different dried chilies, among them bird's eye chilies and Thai long chilies. Green curry paste features many of the same chilies as red but in their fresh state (as opposed to dried), plus cilantro and kaffir lime leaves to give it a vibrant, green color. Meanwhile, yellow curry paste gets its color from fresh turmeric and curry powder."", 'What does curry paste taste like?', 'The spiciest option, red curry paste is rich and fiery. Green curry paste is often considered the most popular of the three because it offers a mild, balanced flavor that is both rich and herbaceous. Yellow curry paste is heartwarming and slightly sweet and its spiciness can vary depending on the types of chilies used.', 'How is curry paste used?', ""The most common use for curry paste is, unsurprisingly, in curries. To make one, you typically add the curry paste to a skillet, followed by the protein or veggies, then a liquid such as stock or coconut milk. The mixture is then simmered slowly until the sauce is thick and fragrant and everything is cooked through and is usually served over rice. However, you can bring curry paste's deep flavor to a variety of recipes. You can use it in a marinade or as a rub for chicken, fish, or beef. Mixing it with vinegar or yogurt will result in a tasty salad dressing. What's more, adding curry paste at the beginning of cooking can help you build flavor in soups and stews."", 'What should I look for when buying curry paste?', ""You'll find curry paste in the international aisle at most supermarkets—Thai Kitchen (which makes green and red curry paste) is the brand that is most widely available. It can be stored in the cupboard until you open it, then it should move to the fridge. As far as flavors, each brand will likely have a slightly different recipe, so experimentation is the best way to find the recipe that suits your taste. If you have a shellfish allergy, make sure you check the ingredients list, since many curry pastes are made with shrimp paste."", 'Make your own Thai Red Curry Paste.', 'What about Indian curry?', ""Next to Thai, curry is most prevalent in Indian cooking. It's true that an Indian curry may look similar to a Thai curry upon serving, but the cooking process is different. Thai curry starts with curry paste and is commonly thickened with coconut milk. Meanwhile, Indian curry begins with a base of tomatoes and onions that have been cooked down, followed by the addition of a variety of dried spices that transform it into a curry, and finally thickened with yogurt or cream.

Plus, get our top ten recipes using lime leaves so you cook up dishes showcasing this unforgettable flavor at home."", ""Lime leaves impart a bright and pleasantly tangy taste that you'd expect from any citrus.

These little leaves have the power to synergize all of these flavorful ingredients and harmonize dishes with many distinct flavors."", ""These leaves don't come from the limes that you see in U.S. supermarkets.

Others sell them frozen in small or medium-sized bags. You won't notice much of a difference in quality or flavor between the two, so don't hesitate to buy them frozen. If you can't find these options, look for dried lime leaves or canisters of powder."", 'Before tossing whole leaves into dishes, use a sharp knife to remove the tough part of the center rib so that you can eat the whole leaf without chomping through that tough and stringy part of the plant. The powdered form is very fine, so it can be sprinkled in cooked or fresh dishes at any point during cooking. But use small amounts at a time and then taste your dish before adding more because the flavor can be quite potent.', ""Keep frozen leaves in the freezer. If you buy them fresh, store them in the fridge, and if you don't use them all within a few weeks, transfer them to the freezer.

How can anyone make lasagna without baking it? Well, trust us,"" says Shauna James Ahern. ""This lasagna is well worth making. If you have a 6- or 7-inch springform pan and you kept the trivet that came with your Instant Pot, you can make a delicious layered lasagna pie in 30 minutes. And if you want to make it ahead, you can prep the lasagna, put it in the freezer, then put it right into the Instant Pot for an easy dinner.""', '""If you love risotto but hate all of the stirring and time involved, you\'ll love making it in the Instant Pot,"" says lutzflcat.

""She was considered the Julia Child of Italian food, and at a time when most Americans thought \'Bolognese\' was spaghetti sauce with chunks of hamburger, Marcella taught us just how magnificent this meat sauce could be. I like to toss it with some mezzi rigatoni and serve it with a little grated Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of parsley.""', '""This is the type of dish I never make the same way twice,"" says Chef John. ""To make minestrone soup precisely same way every time, using a very specific list of ingredients and amounts, is to trample on the soul of this Italian classic. Still, I hope you give this amazing minestrone recipe a try...but only once.', '""This recipe produces one of the more uniquely flavored braised beef dishes I\'ve ever had,"" says Chef John. ""Beef shank is the traditional cut of meat to use, but short ribs worked really well. You could even use beef chuck, cut into two-inch pieces. Keep cooking until a fork goes in easily. The story goes that terracotta tile workers in Impruneta, Tuscany, would place this stew into clay pots and cook it in their still-hot kilns overnight where it would be ready in the morning.""', '""There are only two things you need for great lasagna: a thick, rich, super-meaty meat sauce and lots of it, and a ricotta filling where only the finest cheeses are welcomed,"" says Chef John. ""For the sauce, I love a combination of half Italian sausage and half lean ground beef. I also like lots of sauce.""', '""In Italy, \'saltimbocca\' means \'jumps in the mouth,\'"" explains Chef John. ""This tender, juicy and delicious pork tenderloin is finished with a rich meaty sauce and will certainly please your palate. Feel free to use the more classic veal loin, but the pork tenderloin really works beautifully. It\'s just as tender, and maybe even a bit more forgiving if slightly overcooked.""', '""This is stuffed, rolled beef that\'s cooked in a little bit of tomato sauce,"" says Chef John. ""It is one of my all-time favorite Italian recipes, and a great dish to learn, since it can be varied in many delicious ways. So consider this video recipe a lesson in the technique of pounding, stuffing, and rolling the braciole - which will hopefully inspire you to fill it with your favorite dried fruit, nuts, herbs, cheese, etc.""', '""Agrodolce, a generic Italian term for any type of sweet and sour condiment, really shines when used for braising chunks of succulent pork shoulder,"" says Chef John. ""This soul-warming comfort food is amazing served on rice, pasta, polenta, or, as seen here, a big pile of ricotta mashed potatoes. I\'m not sure if Italians barbecue like we do here in the States, but the sauce very much reminded me of something we\'d brush on a rack of ribs while sipping a cold beer.""', '""I spent a few days in Florence about 30 years ago, and while I don\'t remember much, I do recall my surprise at how delicious the Tuscan fish stew was,"" says Chef John. ""What I found so interesting was how herbs like oregano, sage, and rosemary, which I\'d only associated with meat, were also used with seafood. Also, FYI just in case any old-school Tuscans are coming over: I hear that for this to qualify as an official Italian fish stew you need use at least 5 different types of seafood, which is both insane and adorable. Serve with crusty bread.""', '""Spaghetti al tonno is one of my all-time favorite go-to pasta dishes,"" says Chef John. ""I love a classic meat sauce as much as the next half-Italian, but when I want something quick and easy for a weeknight meal, I reach for the tuna. What if you don\'t like fish? Then this is perfect. The taste and texture is really closer to a veal sauce than one made with fish.""', '""I love chicken parm, especially when it\'s made with fresh mozzarella, which it almost never is in restaurants,"" says Chef John. ""Of course, at home we can use the real stuff, but it can be pricey. So I tried something new--a cheese spread using ricotta fortified with sharp Cheddar. The creamy ricotta made a great base into which you could add any melting cheese. I really enjoyed the Cheddar, but I\'d like to try this with other options, such as provolone, fontina, or even Gruyere. ""', '""Homemade meatballs are a very easy to make,"" says Chef John. ""And since we skip the very messy step of pan-frying these before they hit the sauce, it becomes downright simple. Here I use a standard half-beef/half-pork mixture. You can substitute water or beef broth for the milk, if preferred. The other trick here is to soak the bread crumbs in milk for a moister, more tender meatball. This is one of those dishes that just get better -- more tender and flavorful-- the next day.""', '""This classic Italian-American comfort food works with any kind of sausage, but I like the fennel and anise flavors of sweet Italian sausage with the beans -- it\'s a hearty soup that\'s fast and easy to put together,"" says Chef John.', '""The key to this panzanella is frying the bread cubes in loads of olive oil in a skillet, which obviously makes them crispy,"" says Chef John. ""But the healthful fat also soaks into the bread cubes and renders them semi-waterproof, or dressing-proof. The same goes for the dusting of Parmesan cheese applied halfway through the crisping process.""', '""When the weather gets a little colder, this pork stew really hits the spot,"" says Chef John. ""Pork shoulder meat is braised in a creme fraiche sauce until amazingly tender and delicious. Serve on polenta with crisp sage leaves for garnish.""', '""One of my earliest and most vivid food memories was when my uncle Bill would make his famous dried Italian sausage every Christmas Eve,"" says Chef John. ""They\'d be fried after Midnight Mass and served on bread with roasted red peppers. This fresh version was inspired by those. If you can manage not to eat them right away, letting them dry for a day or two really deepens the flavor, and firms up the texture as well, in true Uncle Billy fashion.""', 'Here\'s a meat sauce that\'s very old, virtually unknown, but very tasty. ""I have no idea why this amazingly flavorful Genovese-style meat sauce isn\'t way more popular than it is,"" says Chef John. ""It\'s quite simply one of the best pasta sauces you\'ll ever taste, thanks to a very slow cooking process, and massive amounts of onions. Once everything is prepped, the recipe couldn\'t be easier. Simmer until the meat and onions melt into each other, and serve.""', '""This technique turns out beautifully light, tender gnocchi every time and are just as good, if not better, than the classic potato-based gnocchi,"" says Chef John. ""And much easier. Plus you can make them ahead of time and brown them in butter before serving.""', '""This is my favorite method of making Italian sausage spaghetti,"" says Chef John. ""By browning the sausages first and then cooking them in the sauce at a long, slow simmer, the sausage is loaded with flavor and firm, but tender--almost meatball-like in texture. And we hardly need any seasonings because the long cook time allows the sauce to get infused with all the sausage-y goodness!""', '""We\'re going to simplify traditional porchetta by making a smaller, simpler version using pork shoulder,"" says Chef John. ""It makes a great sandwich, especially topped with some fried, crispy pancetta.""', '""This comforting and substantial white bean and sausage stew is a soup that eats like a meal!"" says Chef John. ""Browning the sausage in a dry pan creates a beautiful fond that adds rich flavor. With beans, greens, and sausage, this stew is incredibly nutritious and warms you from the inside out. Serve with a hunk of crusty Italian bread.""', '""I\'ve wanted to make carabaccia ever since I found out it was the ancient ancestor of French onion soup,"" says Chef John. ""They say that when made with vegetable broth, it was the favorite soup of vegetarian Leonardo da Vinci. Now you can add these interesting facts to your dinner party conversation repertoire. As for the cinnamon, the safe play is to not add any and live happily ever after. But in tiny amounts it lends a mysterious, warming background note.""']"

Its pungent flavor is composed of earthy/musty, green, hay and minty notes. Try it in Exquisite Pizza Sauce.', 'Basil: Used in tomato sauces, pestos, pizzas, cheeses, and Italian seasonings, basil is slightly bitter and musty--tea-like, with green/grassy, hay, and minty notes. Early Romans made basil a symbol of love and fertility; young Italian suitors wore sprigs of it as a sign of their marital intentions. Try it in Classic Pesto.', 'Rosemary: Popular in seasoning blends for meats and Mediterranean cuisines, rosemary has a distinctive pine-woody aroma and a fresh, bittersweet flavor. Try it in Rosemary Pasta in Roasted Garlic Sauce.', 'Fennel: Used to flavor fish, sausages, baked goods, and liqueurs, fennel has a sweet, licorice-like flavor similar to anise but less intense, with slight menthol and musty/green flavor notes. It is also one of the few plants where the roots, stalk, seeds, fronds and pollen are all used. Originating in the Mediterranean, fennel was carried north from Italy by monks, and today it is used in nearly every cuisine. Try it in Baked Fennel with Parmesan.', 'Sage: Highly aromatic, with piney, woody notes, sage is ideal for flavoring pork, beef, poultry, lamb, tomatoes, squash, potatoes, rice, pasta and much more. Traditionally, sage was used for its antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Try it in Italian Pork Tenderloin.', 'Flat-leaf parsley: Also known as ""Italian parsley,"" its flavor and aroma profile is green and vegetative. It is popular in egg dishes, soups, stews, stocks and with other herbs to bring out their flavor. Parsley also adds visual appeal to many dishes. Try it in Andrew\'s Herb Risotto.', 'Semolina pasta: Most good pasta is made from semolina, durum wheat more coarsely ground than regular wheat flour. Try it with Fresh Semolina and Egg Pasta.', 'Polenta: This cornmeal mush is a staple of northern Italy and can be eaten at any meal. For something different, fry up squares of chilled leftover polenta. Try it in Vegan Polenta with Ragu.', 'Arborio or Carnaroli rice: The high starch content of these chubby, short-grained rice varieties is essential for risotto. The slow cooking and steady stirring allow the grains to gradually release starch, thickening the dish and resulting in a creamy textured risotto. Try arborio rice in Gourmet Mushroom Risotto and carnaroli rice in Risotto a la Pavese.', 'Olive oil: Ranging in color from grassy green to pale champagne-gold, olive oil adds flavor and luscious mouth feel to foods. Extra-virgin olive oil is delicious and redolent, best in salads and marinades or poured directly over pastas and other foods. Try it in Olive Oil-Poached Tuna.', 'Balsamic vinegar: A special vinegar from Modena, Italy, that achieves its beautiful color and depth of flavor only after spending years in wooden barrels, where it concentrates into a complex syrup. Drizzle balsamic vinegar over figs, strawberries, or Parmigiano Reggiano for fantastic flavor combinations. Try it in Balsamic Bruschetta.Tomatoes: Delectable raw or cooked, tomatoes pair beautifully with so many foods and flavors: cheeses, meats, onions, garlic, peppers and herbs; pizza, pastas, salsas, salads, soups, stews — and on and on.', 'Eggplant: A very versatile veggie, eggplants can be baked, boiled and fried. However, they can really sponge-up while frying in oil. To avoid excess absorption, coat eggplant slices well with batter or crumbs before sliding them into hot oil. Try them in Italian Baked Eggplant with Parmesan (Parmigiana di Melanzane).', 'Porcini mushrooms: These wild mushrooms are usually found in dried form and have a meaty texture and woodsy flavor. They are particularly good in soups, stuffing and stews and with braised meats. Before using in recipes, soak dried porcinis in hot water for about 20 minutes — and use some of the soaking water in your recipe. Try them in True Italian Porcini Mushroom Risotto.', 'Cannellini beans: The large, white kidney beans are available dry or canned and are popular in salads, soups, and stews. Try them in Italian White Bean and Sausage Stew.', 'Lemons: Lemons add bright flavor to such a wide range of dishes, from sweet to savory. This juicy, acidic fruit is also an important ingredient in drinks, including limoncello, the famous lemon liqueur from southern Italy. Try lemons in Lemon Chicken Piccata.', ""Parmigiano-Reggiano: This is the real deal, the pinnacle of Parmesan cheeses, whose rich, complex flavor comes from the aging process. Made from skimmed or partially skimmed cow's milk, Parmigiano-Reggiano is a hard, grating cheese with a light golden rind and a straw-colored interior. Try our collection of Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese Recipes."", 'Mozzarella: This mild white cheese is tops for pizza, lasagna, and other classic Italian dishes. Fresh mozzarella has a more delicate flavor and is not as elastic as the drier semi-soft kind typically sold pre-packaged. Fresh mozzarella is generally made from whole milk, packaged in water or whey and labeled ""Italian style."" Check out our collection of Mozzarella Recipes.', 'Ricotta cheese: An important ingredient in classic Italian dishes like lasagna and manicotti, ricotta is a moist fresh cheese that\'s rich and smooth. The word ""ricotta"" means ""re-cooked"" in Italian and refers to the fact that ricotta is made by draining the whey off of other cheeses and heating it. So, technically, ricotta isn\'t cheese but a byproduct of cheese-making. Try making your own Sicilian Homemade Ricotta Cheese. And explore our collection of Ricotta Cheese Recipes.', ""Capers: These are the tiny flower buds from a bush that grows in the Mediterranean. They're typically pickled in vinegary brine or sometimes packed in salt. For something so small, they add big pungent flavor to sauces, condiments, and meat and vegetable dishes. Try them in Chicken Piccata with Capers"", 'Pine nuts: Italian pine nuts have a delicate flavor and are used in sweet and savory dishes. They are probably best known as an ingredient that lends big flavor to Italian pesto.', 'Almonds: Available whole, sliced, chopped, candied, smoked, in paste, blanched, roasted and salted, almonds are loaded with good stuff. They contain calcium, fiber, folic acid, magnesium, potassium, riboflavin and vitamin E. Toast them to intensify the flavor and add a satisfying crunch. Try them in Almond Biscotti.', 'Prosciutto di Parma: Another classic ingredient from the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy in the province of Parma. Proscuitto means ""ham"" in Italian and salt-cured prosciutto di Parma is tops in the field. The secret is the pig\'s diet of chestnuts and whey. Try it with Prosciutto e Melone (Italian Ham and Melon).', 'Anchovies: Real anchovies are found only in the Mediterranean. They are typically filleted, cured in salt, and canned in oil. Anchovies can be soaked in cool water to dilute the saltiness. Use sparingly to add depth of flavor to sauces, salads, and pizza. Try it in Puttanesca Pasta.', 'Olives: Along with grapes and bread, olives were part of the sacred triad of Roman ingredients. They remain an important ingredient in Italian cuisine, appearing in everything from antipasto plates, to pasta and secondi dishes. Try them in Sicilian Olive Chicken.', 'Check out our collection of Italian Recipes.']"

The bread is then served warm either with a topping spooned over or with a topping on the side so each person can build their own bruschetta. Bruschetta is meant to be served as a hand-held finger food, large enough for one or two bites.', ""You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:"", 'The best bread for bruschetta has a sturdy crust and is firm enough to hold the bruschetta topping. Choose a loaf of Italian bread, such as ciabatta, for a more traditional bruschetta. This recipe uses slices of French bread, like a baguette. Slice the bread on the diagonal at least ¼-inch thick or more to make an oval shape.', ""You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here are a few of our favorite tips for making the best bruschetta every time:"", ""· Quality counts: The beauty of a simple recipe like bruschetta is that it showcases the flavor of the individual ingredients. For this recipe, you can really taste the difference when you use ripe tomatoes and fresh (not dried) basil; the best olive oil and balsamic vinegar you can afford, and hand-grated Parmesan cheese instead of pre-packaged grated cheese.· Add flavor with garlic: As an alternative to adding minced raw garlic to the tomato mixture, cut a peeled clove of garlic in half lengthwise and lightly rub the cut side over the slightly roughened surface of the toasted bread to impart a hint of garlic flavor. Rub on a little more garlic for a stronger flavor, if you wish. But watch out: A little garlic goes a long way.· Be patient: Make the tomato mixture and let it sit for a couple of hours so the flavors can develop more complexity. Yes, the tomatoes may give off a lot of juice as they marinate, but if you think the mixture is too juicy come serving time, simply use a slotted spoon to lift out the bruschetta topping as you spoon it over the bread. Don't toss the liquid, though — lots of people love to dip into it with extra bread.

And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home."", ""In fact, chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in your own kitchen. The main problem I have with most versions of Chicken Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much sauce and cheese that it ends up being a big soggy clump of chicken and cheese. But it doesn't have to be that way, not with this method."", ""Unlike many restaurant preparations, this method doesn't overwhelm the chicken with sauce and cheese. The key to great non-soggy chicken Parmesan? Don't put any sauce under the chicken cutlets, just a little bit of sauce on top, so the breading stays relatively crisp. If you like a lot of sauce on your chicken Parmesan, that's fine, you can always serve extra sauce on the side. I also use some actual Parmesan cheese in this recipe! Curiously, most versions of chicken Parmesan only use mozzarella. Here, I'm going with a delicious mixture of fresh mozzarella, tangy Provolone and real Parmesan."", ""Another little trick I employ here is to add some grated Parmesan to the breadcrumbs, which adds another layer of flavor.

Then don't bother with salting the flour and bread crumbs."", '3. Add Parmesan to the bread crumbs Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated Parmesan cheese.

Rest before cookingBefore frying, let the breaded chicken sit on the counter for about 15 minutes to allow the coating to adhere to the chicken breast.', ""5. Go easy on the sauce THE KEY: Don't drown the poor breaded and fried chicken in sauce and smother it in cheese. Too much of a good thing is too much. You did all the work creating a crisp coating, why make it soggy with too much sauce and cheese?"", ""6. Make sure your oven is hot, hot, hot Be sure your oven is completely preheated to 450 F.

Thaw frozen shrimp before using.· Pasta: This recipe uses a 16-ounce package of linguine, but you can substitute the pasta of your choice, like angel hair pasta, fettuccine, or spaghetti.· Butter: Use unsalted butter. You can add salt to taste later in the recipe.· Extra-virgin olive oil: The flavor of the olive oil comes through in this recipe, so use the best quality.· Shallots and garlic: These aromatics add flavor and fragrance to shrimp scampi.· White wine: Use a dry, crisp white wine for shrimp scampi sauce. Pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc are good choices, and you can drink the leftover wine with dinner.· Lemon juice: Use freshly squeezed lemon juice for the best flavor.· Seasonings: Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper amplify the flavors, and a pinch of dried red pepper flakes give shrimp scampi a subtle kick.

Sprinkle a generous amount of salt over the eggplant slices to draw out the moisture, then wipe it away when it's time to fry.· When you're baking the coated eggplant slices, it doesn't hurt to turn on the broiler at the end.

Many dishes skip the usual tortilla-beans-rice trio altogether: Think vibrant soups, messy sandwiches, and a cheesy grilled corn salad. Others are specific to their region, like a shrimp classic from the coastal state of Sinaloa or tortilla pizzas from Oaxaca. All are worth adding to your Mexican meal rotation, especially with these easy, authentic recipes.', ""We all love Mexican flavors and plate-sized pizzas, so it's a wonder this super-simple dish isn't a staple at home or at most neighborhood Mexican restaurants. This Oaxacan dish consists of a large tortilla that's topped with refried beans and seared or baked, then finished with toppings like cotija cheese, tomato, and avocado. It's different from tostadas, which are smaller and deep-fried. Try these Mexican-inspired Fiesta Corn Tortilla Pizzas for a true tlayuda experience, or use the tortilla pizza inspiration for crowd-pleasing BBQ Chicken Tortilla Pizzas."", ""This light, brothy chicken soup gets its brightness from a generous dose of fresh lime juice. It comes from the Yucatan region in the Gulf of Mexico, where it's just as welcome on a hot day as on a cool one. Just like tortilla soup, crispy tortilla strips are a common garnish. The chicken and lime are the constants in most recipes; the veggies, herbs, and chiles vary from house to house. Nearly 100 5-star reviews make this Sopa de Lima recipe a great place to start."", 'The original elote was sold as an on-the-go snack on the streets of Mexico City. The blueprint: Corn on the cob brushed with mayo, coated in crumbled cotija or queso fresco, sprinkled with ground chile, and doused in lime juice. This Elote Salad keeps those same flavors but takes the corn off the cob for an easy-to-eat side. Serve at your next cookout, add to your burrito bowl, or top a taco or quesadilla.', ""Menudo is the unofficial soup of Mexico. You'll find it served all over the country at casual family gatherings, birthdays, wedding receptions, and (notoriously) as a next-morning hangover cure. Traditionally, tripe is boiled for hours until tender, then added to a spicy, chile-laced broth with hominy and lime. Recipe creator Gustavo06 sticks to tradition with his Menudo Rojo, but you could swap the tripe for stew beef."", 'If beef tacos make you think of ground beef and lots of seasoning, you have to give barbacoa a try. Traditionally, a whole goat or sheep is buried in an underground oven and slowly cooked overnight. Modern versions use beef cuts like chuck roast and are braised in the oven or cooked in the slow cooker. This Barbacoa-Style Shredded Beefuses the slow cooker. The result is so tender you could pull the meat apart with a fork. Pile onto tacos, tostadas, or burritos.', 'The city of Guadalajara is known for this ""drowned"" sandwich. Think of it as the Mexican equivalent of a French dip: A roll stuffed with thinly sliced meat, then ""half drowned"" (served with a thin, chile-flavored sauce for dipping) or ""well drowned"" (completely submerged in the sauce). Like all big sandwiches, it\'s messy in the best possible way. Give it a try with this Drowned Beef Sandwich with Chipotle Sauce (Torta Ahogada) recipe.', 'What makes this Mexican soup different from a tortilla soup or chili is the addition of hominy—a type of corn that\'s been dried and rehydrated to give it a chewy, starchy texture. Just like chili, you\'ll find white and red versions, vegetarian and meat versions, and loaded and simplified versions. Enjoy this Slow Cooker Pozole with lots of fresh toppings. ""Traditional Mexican Posole is served with shredded cabbage, lime wedges, avocado, onion, cilantro, and, of course, warm tortillas,"" says Jules, who submitted the recipe.', ""While cochinita means baby pig, most versions of this slow-roasted pork dish begin with pork shoulder. A citrus-heavy marinade helps to tenderize the meat. It's then wrapped in banana leaves and gently cooked in an underground oven (called a píib) until fall-apart tender. A standard oven cooks the pork in this Cochinita Pibil recipe."", 'A dish that translates to ""chile water"" may not sound like much, which means you\'ll be incredibly surprised by how delicious it is. This recipe hails from Sinaloa, a coastal state on the western side of Mexico that is known for its seafood. In this Aguachile recipe, fresh shrimp is marinated in a blend of chiles and lime. Just like ceviche, the lime ""cooks"" the shrimp while it marinates. Cool, crunchy cucumber and red onion are classic garnishes.', ""No, these Swiss enchiladas weren't invented in Europe. They originated at the Sanborn's Café in Mexico City in 1950. This recipe uses a creamy tomatillo sauce and lots of cheese. All that dairy gave the restaurant the idea to give the dish a Swiss inspiration.

Tamales are usually wrapped in dried corn husks that have been soaked in water to make them soft and pliable. Occasionally, people will use fresh corn husks or banana leaves to wrap their tamales.', ""Dough. Tamale dough is a mixture of masa, lard, and salt. Fresh masa is dried corn that has been cooked in limewater, soaked overnight, and then ground up while still wet. This makes the lightest, fluffiest tamales. If fresh masa isn't available, you can use masa harina, flour made from dried masa. Masa harina just needs to have extra liquid added to it."", 'Filling. The most well-known tamale recipes have a filling of braised pork or beef in a complex sauce of spices and dried and fresh chiles. Tamales can also be stuffed with chicken, vegetables, cheese, beans, seafood, or even fruit and nuts.', 'Building a Better Tamale', ""For light and fluffy tamale dough, whip the lard and salt with electric beaters for a few minutes before adding the masa. Once you add the masa, continue to whip, adding water or meat broth until the mixture is the consistency of soft cookie dough. Test it by dropping a small ball of dough into a glass of water. If the dough sinks, it needs more liquid whipped into it; if it floats, it's ready to use. If you prefer not to cook with lard, substitute an equal amount of vegetable shortening, although the dough will not have the same fullness of flavor."", 'To assemble:', 'Have fun! Making tamales can easily turn into an all-day affair, which is why Mexican families reserve them as a treat for very special occasions.

The state of Oaxaca is located in the south of the country and boasts incredible geographic diversity with mountain ranges, canyons, valleys, rivers, and coastline along the Pacific with nine major bays. These varying climates afford Oaxacan cuisine a wealth of various ingredients: seafood from coastal areas, vegetables from the Central Valley region, and tropical fruits from the northeast near Veracruz. And because of the area\'s rich history and isolated terrain, Oaxaca has preserved and officially recognized 16 indigenous cultures, each with unique culinary traditions that enrich Oaxaca\'s striking culinary landscape. This is nowhere more evident than in the region\'s iconic mole sauce, of which there are officially seven types—but every Abuela, or ""grandmother,"" has her own special family recipe, carried down through generations.', ""But before we dive into the wonders of mole sauce, let's explore the key ingredients in Oaxacan cuisine and the most famous dishes made with them."", ""As with all of Mexico for thousands of years, corn is Oaxaca's staple ingredient. It is most often dried and ground into a masa dough, featured in the region's beloved tamales or used to make tortillas, which are incorporated into almost every meal—whether as a vessel for meat and vegetables or as a side dish for dipping into rich savory sauces or soups."", ""Oaxacan cooking favors a variety of mainly black beans, most often prepared with aniseed and served as a topping or a black-bean-style soup. It's most notably used on tlayuda, which is almost like an Oaxacan pizza (more on that below)."", ""Oaxacan chile peppers are renowned by chefs and highly prized for their one-of-a-kind flavor profile. They are traditionally smoke-dried in a slow process that brings out each pepper variety's unique piquancy. These dried chile peppers are one of the most important ingredients in mole sauces."", ""Chocolate is grown throughout Oaxaca and is used in the region's famous mole negro, but it's the region's ubiquitous hot chocolate beverage that the ingredient is best known for. For this delicious drink, the cacao beans are hand-ground, then mixed with hot milk, sugar, almonds, cinnamon and other warming spices."", 'Also known as quesillo, Oaxacan cheese is similar to mozzarella, but a bit softer and presented in ropes like string cheese. Cooks and street vendors rip off rough strips of the soft cheese and sprinkle them on a number of dishes like quesadillas.', 'Oaxacan cuisine features a number of edible insects, but the most popular is, by far, its grasshoppers, or chapulines. They are toasted to crunchy perfection in a comal, or earthenware griddle, over hot coals, then seasoned with garlic, lime juice, and salt. They are eaten by themselves as snacks, as a filling for tacos and the like, or as a salty crunchy topping.', 'Huitlacoche, or corn fungus, is a noteworthy Oaxacan delicacy. Also known as ""Mexico\'s truffle,"" the strange-looking fungus has a mushroom-like earthiness and slight sweetness that is so lovely, it commands top dollar—or top peso. Next time you\'re in Oaxaca and you see huitlacoche as a taco or empanada filling, don\'t shy away from the opportunity to taste this special ingredient. Here it fills crispy quesadillas.', 'There are seven distinct types of mole: negro (black), amarillo (yellow), coloradito (little red), mancha manteles (""tablecloth-stainer""), chichilo (named after the sauce\'s main chile pepper), rojo (red), and verde (green). Many would argue that the mole negro is Oaxaca\'s finest mole. It consists of smoke-dried chile peppers charred on a comal over hot coals, almonds, pecans, tomatoes, tomatillos, white onion, garlic, plantain, peppercorns, cloves, cinnamon, biscuit-like cookies, a chocolate bread, raisins, prunes, oregano herb mixture, and chocolate, among other things. The labor- and time-intensive sauce is usually served over fall-off-the-bone chicken, pork, or beef and alongside any combination of rice, tortilla, salsas, and sometimes topped with crunchy grasshoppers. But the sauce—a tantalizing mix of smoky char, piquant heat, sweet chocolate and fruit notes, earthy spices, and salty goodness—is definitely the star of the show.', 'Try this Authentic Mole Sauce or the verde mole in this Pollo Oaxaca dish.', ""Across Mexico, tamales are a beloved treat enjoyed morning, noon, and night in both savory and sweet iterations. Normally, the pillowy masa dough is stuffed with any combo of stewed meats, cheeses, vegetables, fruit, or chocolate, then steamed in a corn husk.

I’m told Rhys makes a mean toad-in-the-hole, and I hope they enjoy this version for years to come. In Yorkshire, I learned how real Yorkshire folk approach making a great Yorkie. They aren’t into making their batter the night before, instead they focus on getting plenty of air into the batter and achieving a hot consistent temperature in the oven. I truly love this great classic and have only ever had one issue with it: quite often, you end up with half a sausage (the toad) poking out of the Yorkshire (the hole). The bit sticking out is crispy and golden – good times – but the other half of the sausage, inside the batter, is soft, anaemic and boiled – bad times. So in the spirit of family-style sharing and creating a dish that makes everyone go ‘Oooh!’ I’m separating out the elements so you end up with amazing crispy sausages, a tray of giant Yorkshire to tear up and a wonderful onion and apple gravy.

Pick in the leaves from 2 sprigs of rosemary. Cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden. Remove the sauce from the heat once soft, season, and add the honey and a splash of water, if needed.

Cover with tin foil. Remove any excess fat from the roasting tray, replace with a good lug of olive oil and place on a medium heat. Add the remaining rosemary leaves and after 30 seconds, pour in the batter, then put straight into the middle of the oven with the sausages on the shelf underneath. Cook for around 8 to 10 minutes, or until the pudding is fluffy, golden and puffing up at the sides. Whatever you do, do not open the oven door.', 'Put the pan of apples and onions back on a high heat and stir in the flour. Be brave; let it get really golden before adding the cider, stock and a couple of really good splashes of Worcestershire sauce. Let it boil and bubble away until thickened to your liking.

Basically it’s a bold rub that fragrantly flavours fish and meat and goes dark when it cooks, thanks to the paprika and garlic.', 'Traditionally this dish has been made with the locally caught redfish, but it’s also great with any whole or filleted white fish. It goes with so many things, including chicken, pork, lamb and steak. When I was in Louisiana I cooked it on a barbecue, but I’ve shown you below how to do it indoors in a pan. Don’t be scared by how black the spices go: they’ll look burnt but the taste will be amazing.', ""To make the rub, bash up your fresh herbs and garlic in a pestle and mortar until you've got a nice coarse paste. Mix in the spices, 1 teaspoon of sea salt, 1 level tablespoon of black pepper and the olive oil, then squeeze in the juice of half the lemon, making sure not to let any pips get in there, and stir well."", ""Lightly score the skin of your fish in lines about 2cm apart. Using your fingers, smear the rub all over both sides of the fish and into the cuts you've made. Put a non-stick pan or griddle pan over a medium-high heat and let it get nice and hot. Place your fish in the pan, skin side down, and let it cook for 3 to 4 minutes. It will get quite smoky, so you might want to open a window! Turn the heat down to low, then, very carefully, flip your fish over and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes on the second side."", 'Cut your remaining lemon half and your second lemon into wedges for squeezing over. Serve them with your fish, a nice salad and boiled or steamed new potatoes dressed in good olive oil or butter. Don’t forget a nice cold glass of wine!']"

Tear off 8 sheets of good- quality cling film, each roughly 40cm square. Get yourself 4 teacups or small bowls and rub the rims with olive oil. Place a double layer of cling film on top of each one and carefully push it in so that it snugly lines the cups. Use your finger to lightly oil the inside – this will help your egg come out easily at the end. Put a tiny pinch of salt, pepper and chilli flakes into each cup then pick the celery and tarragon leaves and divide them between the cups too – try to help these flavours to spread up the sides, if you can.', 'Carefully crack the egg into the cling film, then gently push the yolk down so the egg white surrounds it (without it breaking). Bring the cling film up into a bundle, then tie it in a knot and try to squeeze the knot down so it creates a perfect pouch and seals it (imagine a goldfish in a fairground plastic bag).', 'Once the water is boiling, remove the bowl (the butter should be melted now) and place your eggs in the water along with the asparagus. It takes between 5 and 6 minutes at a gentle simmer for a large egg.

If it still seems undercooked, pop it back in for another minute or so.', 'Neatly divide the asparagus between your plates. Cut off the cling film knots with a pair of scissors, peel away the rest, then carefully lift the eggs with a tablespoon and serve them right on top of your asparagus. If you‘ve done a good job, not only will you have perfect poached eggs, but the herbs and seasonings will have cooked into the egg and become one, like a stained glass window, which is really cute.

Pour a few drizzles of extra virgin olive oil into a separate little pan and put it on a medium heat. Add the garlic, dried chilli and anchovy, then squeeze in and add the cherry tomatoes as the garlic begins to fry – at no point should the garlic take on any colour, but you need the heat to be hot enough to melt the anchovies. The juice from the tomatoes and oil will make a light, very delicate and simple sauce.', 'Add the linguine to the pan of boiling water and cook according to packet instructions. Meanwhile, add a good handful of washed and debearded mussels to the tomato sauce. Give the pan a little toss, then place a lid on top and cook until all the mussels are open. As usual with mussels, if any remain closed after cooking, throw them away. Add a handful of chopped parsley to the pan.', 'The pasta will now be a little under al dente and only a minute away from being ready. Nonno likes to drain his pasta, saving a little of the cooking water, then he puts the pasta back into the big pot and pours the mussel sauce over the top, mixing everything together well. Put the pot back on a low heat for an extra minute or two to cook the pasta perfectly – it will suck up all the lovely mussel juice. To finish, drizzle over a good bit of olive oil, season to taste and serve immediately.']"

So we had a scout around the supermarkets and developed a really delicious and impressive recipe for this. It’s dramatic and stretches the meat a fairly long way. The case of pastry and minced mushrooms keeps the breast moist and delicious and is a little forgiving so the meat holds its juices. You could assemble it a day before and just leave it in the fridge ready to over deliver on Christmas day.', 'Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Place the turkey breast upside-down on a board. Gently slice into the natural join of the breast muscle to open it out and make a sort of pocket. Season well and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle over half the thyme leaves, then spread over an even layer of cranberry jam, pushing it into all the nooks and crannies. Fold it back into shape to seal the mixture inside – swiss roll-stylie – and push a few cocktail sticks into the seam to keep it together. Transfer the turkey to a roasting tray, season the outside with the remaining thyme leaves, a good pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. Rub it all over, cover in tin foil and roast in the hot oven for 60 to 70 minutes, or until just cooked through – using a thermometer, you want it to be 72°C at the thickest point.', 'Meanwhile, soak the porcini in a dish of just-boiled water. After 5 minutes, stir with a fork so any bits of grit sink to the bottom. Add the bacon to a large frying pan with a splash of oil on a medium heat and fry for 5 to 10 minutes, or until beautifully golden and super crispy. Strip in the leaves from 2 rosemary sprigs for the last 30 seconds or so. Remove everything from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the bacon fat behind. Add the fresh mushrooms to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper. Drain and chop the porcini, saving the water, then stir into the pan. Add a splash of the water, avoiding the grit, then cook for around 10 to 15 minutes, or until the pan starts to sizzle again and the mushrooms are golden, soft and sticky with caramelly edges.', 'To make the gravy, cut the thigh off the turkey leg and slash into it slightly. Throw the leg and thigh into a pot along with the carrot, leek and onion. Stir in the flour, add a good pinch of salt and pepper and 2 litres of boiling water. Add a heaped tablespoon of cranberry jam, the balsamic vinegar and remaining rosemary sprig. Bring back to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for around 2 hours, or until thick. Strain it through a sieve and reheat before serving.', 'When the mushroom pan is dry, add a knob of butter and toss to coat.  Tip the mushrooms into the food processor and whiz until you get a good mixture of smooth and chunky. Leave to cool. Once the turkey breast and stuffing have cooled, you can get on with assembling the wellington.', 'Dust a clean surface with flour, then roll out each packet of puff pastry to the size of a shoe box (one will be the base, one the lid – roll the lid ever so slightly bigger). Line a large roasting tray with greaseproof paper, dust with flour, then add the smaller piece of pastry. Spread half of the mushroom stuffing onto the middle of the base to cover an area the same size as your turkey breast. Remove the cocktail sticks, then place the turkey breast on top and spread the remaining stuffing over the top packing it all in and smoothing it out so that the whole breast is covered.  Sprinkle with the crispy bacon and rosemary, then brush the edges of the pastry with beaten egg. Lay the second sheet of pastry over the top, gently mold it round the shape of the breast, pushing all the air out and seal together. Trim the edges  to around 4cm, then pull, twist, tuck and pinch in the pastry (like in the picture).', 'Brush the whole thing with beaten egg then all the hard work’s done. Leave it uncovered in the fridge overnight until you’re ready to cook. On Christmas day, cook at 180°/350°F/gas 4 for 50 to 60 minutes, or until risen, puffy and beautifully golden and the turkey is piping hot throughout. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for around 10 minutes before carving. Serve carved into 2.5cm with the gravy and all the usual. Christmas in a mouthful.']"

In a large bowl, lightly toss together the spinach, squash and onion-bread mixture, then spoon it in a thick line down the middle of the pastry. Leave a space free at either side so you can roll the pastry around the filling.', 'To do this, hold one side of the baking parchment and lift it, with the pastry, towards the centre of the Wellington so it starts to cover the filling. Peel the baking parchment back, leaving the pastry in place, then do the same with the other side. The pastry should overlap in the middle. Beat the egg with the milk and brush it over the pastry join to seal the join. Fold up the ends so the filling doesn’t leak out, then carefully roll the Wellington onto a baking sheet, with the seal underneath.

It’s an exciting dish and the end result will definitely blow you away, but you’ll have to take a bit of time with it and show it some love.', 'You’ll want to buy the pork from a good butcher and ask for a boneless loin of pork with the skin off (but keep it for crackling) and belly on. Keeping the belly on makes stuffing the pork much easier. A nice little tip is to ask your butcher to give you the bones, as these will make a brilliant trivet to roast your meat on.', 'Preheat your oven to its highest setting. Tear or roughly chop your mushrooms – thick, thin and wonky, it doesn’t matter, you want it chunky and rustic. Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat, add a lug of olive oil, the thyme leaves and mushrooms, and toss around a bit. Next, add the sliced garlic and knob of butter. Fry everything off for about 10 minutes until the mushrooms are browning a little around the edges. Add the lemon zest with a good pinch of salt and pepper, then remove to a bowl and let it cool. Once cool, add the bread and toss together.', 'Now turn your attention to the pork. Lay the loin and belly on a board, fatty-side down, and use a knife to make a little pocket between the loin and the belly meat. Stuff the cooled mushroom mixture into the pocket, then season well all over with salt and pepper. If you’ve got any garlicky, thyme and lemon juices left in the pan, pour these over the pork for some wonderful added flavour. Rub all the seasoning and juices into the pork.', 'Roll the belly around the loin and tie it tightly with 5 or 6 pieces of string to keep it all in place. If your butcher gave you the bones, scatter them around the bottom of an appropriately sized roasting tray – you want the pork to sit quite snugly in the tray - and put the meat on top. Place in the oven and immediately turn it down to 180°C/350°F/gas 4 so the meat cooks through nice and evenly. This is a good time to get the crackling ready for the oven, so score the skin with a small sharp knife to open it up for seasoning. Bash up the fennel seeds and salt in a pestle and mortar, rub a generous amount of this into the skin and place it on a baking tray.', 'After the meat has had an hour in the oven, take it out and add the chopped vegetables and remaining bulb of garlic to the tray, roughly broken apart into unpeeled cloves. Pour in the glass of cider and give the tray a shake to coat everything. Put it all back in the oven to cook for another hour. The crackling can also go in at this point.', 'Before the second hour is up, put a large pan of salted water on to boil. Peel and cut the celeriac and potatoes into even-sized chunks, then boil for 12 to 15 minutes until soft and ready to mash. Drain and let them steam-dry, then return to the pan with a good knob of butter, some seasoning and the milk. Mash until smooth, adding a splash more milk if you need it. Cover and keep warm until ready to serve.', 'When the pork is ready, remove it from the oven on to a plate and cover with tin foil, so it can rest for about 20 minutes while you crack on with the gravy. You’ll have some nice roasted root veg and sticky goodness left in the bottom of the tray. Pour or spoon off the excess fat in the tray, then place it over a very low heat and pour in the stock a little at a time (you may not need to use all of it), using a potato masher as you go to mash up all the vegetables. Keep stirring to make sure you get all the lovely sticky brown bits off the bottom of the tray. Add the flour and keep reducing the gravy down until you get the consistency you like. Pass the gravy through a sieve to get rid of any lumps, then serve with the warm mash, stuffed pork and beautiful crackling.']"

Although curing is easy, it is important to follow the measurements, so try to get a side of salmon as close as possible to the weight I’ve suggested here. \n\nFor the first cure, blitz the beetroots, orange and lemon zest, and bashed juniper berries in a food processor until you get a fairly smooth paste. Transfer this to a bowl and stir in the rock salt and sugar. Pour in the gin and give it a good mix.', 'Lay the side of salmon skin-side down on a large baking tray and slowly pour over the beetroot cure. Use a spatula to spread it all over the salmon flesh. Once it is all well covered, wrap the salmon in a double layer of greaseproof paper then wrap it tightly with cling film and place it in the fridge for 24 hours.', 'The next day, take the salmon out of the fridge and carefully unwrap it so you can rinse off the cure. Either use 100ml of cold water or gin. Hold the salmon over a baking tray and pour a splash at a time over your salmon. Use a spoon to gently push the beetroot cure off the fish. By now it should have shared its wonderful flavours with the fish and turned it a really vibrant colour. Put the rinsed salmon to one side and run the tray under the tap.', 'For the second cure, mix together the chopped herbs, grated horseradish and gin. Put the salmon back into the clean tray, skin-side down, and pack the herby cure onto the salmon using your hands. Make sure you cover all the flesh – you don’t want any air getting to it. Wrap it again with a double layer of greaseproof paper, then a tight layer of cling film. Pop the salmon back in the fridge for another 24 hours.', 'The next day your salmon will be perfectly cured and ready to eat. You don’t need to rinse off that second cure – simply slice the salmon as finely as you can on an angle so you get gorgeous thin slices of gravadlax tinged with pink and topped with herbs. Pile these onto a plate and serve with a couple of slices of buttered brown bread, and some watercress and wedges of lemon.']"

Really good-quality birds do cook in a shorter time so follow the instructions if it has them.', 'This year I’m using a flavoured butter to give a bit of extra love to my turkey, and this is a job you can do the day before. Get your turkey and use a spoon to work your way between the skin and the meat. Start at the side of the cavity just above the leg and work gently up towards the breastbone and towards the back so you create a large cavity. Pick up half of your butter and push it into the cavity you’ve created. Use your hands to push it through the skin right to the back so it coats the breast meat as evenly as possible. Do the same on the other side then rub any leftover butter all over the outside of the bird to use it up. If you’ve got any herb stalks left over, put them in the cavity of the turkey for added flavour as it cooks. Cover the turkey in cling film and keep in the fridge until you need it.', 'Take your turkey out of the fridge a few hours before you are ready to put it in the oven so it has time to come up to room temperature. That flavoured butter will already be under the skin so you’ll only need a few tweaks to finish it off. Halve the clementines and pop them in the cavity with a few more sprigs of fresh herbs like rosemary, bay and thyme. The fruit will steam and flavour the birds in a really lovely way. Take the fresh rosemary, pull off the leaves at the bottom then spear that through the loose skin around the cavity to hold it together and keep it from shrinking back as the turkey cooks.', 'Open up the neck cavity and pack as much stuffing  as possible in there, then carefully pull the skin back over the cavity, tuck it under the bird and pop it in the roasting tray. If you’ve already made your gravy like I’ve done, you won’t need a vegetable trivet, if not, do that now by roughly chopping the carrots, onions and celery sticks. Preheat your oven to full whack, get the turkey in the roasting tray and cover with foil. As soon as it goes in the oven, immediately turn the heat down to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4.', 'As a rough guide, you want to cook the turkey for about 35 to 40 minutes per kilogram, so a 7kg turkey will want about 4 to 4½ hours in the oven. But there are so many variables such as the sort of oven you have and the quality of your bird. Check on your turkey every 30 minutes or so and keep it from drying out by basting it with the lovely juices from the bottom of the pan. After 3½ hours, remove the foil so the skin gets golden and crispy. If you are at all worried just stick a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the breast. When the internal temperature has reached 65ºC for a good quality bird, and about 82ºC for a cheaper bird, it’s ready to come out.', 'Carefully put a metal skewer in the cavity and use it to lift the bird and angle it over the roasting tray so all of the juices from the cavity run out. Move the turkey to a platter then cover it with a double layer of tinfoil and 2 tea towels to keep it warm while it rests for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours for bigger birds.']"

Using your hands, really scrunch and mix the flavours into the tuna, then divide the mixture and squeeze it into meatballs slightly smaller than a golf ball.

If your grocery store has a meat counter you can ask them to grind the meat for you.\n• This can be made completely ahead of time and reheated just before serving.

Once golden, tip them into the mortar and pound up a few times until fine and crunchy, then pour them into a little bowl. Coarsely grate the cucumber on a box grater, then transfer it to a bowl, squeezing out any excess liquid. Finely chop the mint and add it to the bowl with the yoghurt, a good pinch of salt and pepper, and a good squeeze of lemon juice. Stir, then put into a little bowl next to the toasted nuts.', 'Halve the tomatoes and rub each half, cut side down, on the finer side of the grater so you end up with a fresh tomato slurry. Discard the skins, then finely grate in half the chilli. Season with salt and pepper, stir in a squeeze of lemon juice, sprinkle over some coriander leaves, and crumble over a little feta. Have a taste, adjust if you want it a bit spicier, or saltier, then put it into a little bowl next to the other dips.', 'Heat a griddle pan on a high heat and cook the lamb cutlets for around 4 minutes on each side, standing them on their fatty sides for a minute or two extra to crisp up.

I recently discovered a way to make the chicken taste even better, by putting a lemon in with my potatoes when I was parboiling them. It smelt fantastic and flavoured the potatoes. Then when I was draining them I decided to stab the lemon, which hissed out juice and steam, and quickly jammed it inside the chicken! The benefits of the hot steaming lemon going into the chicken are very obvious as the meat tastes amazing, and the chicken cooks slightly quicker because of it.', ""Rub the chicken inside and out with a generous amount of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Do this in the morning if possible, then cover the chicken and leave in the fridge until you're ready to start cooking it for lunch or dinner. By doing this, you'll make the meat really tasty when cooked. Preheat your oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Cut the potatoes into golf-ball-sized pieces, put them into the water with the whole lemon and the garlic cloves, and cook for 12 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for 1 minute (this will give you crispier potatoes), then remove the lemon and garlic. Toss the potatoes in the pan while still hot so their outsides get chuffed up and fluffy – this will make them lovely and crispy when they roast."", 'While the lemon is still hot, carefully stab it about 10 times. Take the chicken out of the fridge, pat it with kitchen paper and rub it all over with olive oil. Push the garlic cloves, the whole lemon and the thyme into the cavity, then put the chicken into a roasting tray and cook in the preheated oven for around 45 minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate. Some lovely fat should have cooked out of it into the roasting tray, so toss the potatoes into this with the rosemary leaves. Shake the tray around, then make a gap in the centre of the potatoes and put the chicken back in. If using the bacon, lay the rashers over the chicken breast and cook for a further 45 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked and the potatoes are nice and golden. (You can tell the chicken is cooked when the thigh meat pulls easily away from the bone and the juices run clear.)', 'I like to remove the bacon from the chicken and crumble it up over the potatoes. Then I remove the lemon and garlic from inside the chicken, squeeze all the garlic flesh out of the skin, mush it up and smear it all over the chicken, discard the lemon and rosemary and carve the chicken at the table.

Add the garlic and thyme leaves and smash up again until you have a kind of paste. The idea here is to build up the flavours. Add enough extra virgin olive oil to generously cover the paste, and a good swig of vinegar. This will be like a marinade, a rub and a dressing all in one! Stir together, then pour over the carrots in the tray, coating them well. Add the orange and lemon halves, cut-side down. These will roast along with the carrots, and their juice can be used as the basis of the dressing. Place in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden.  \nWhile the carrots are roasting, halve and peel your avocados, discarding the stones, then cut them into wedges lengthways and place in a big bowl. Remove the carrots from the oven and add them to the avocados. Carefully, using some tongs, squeeze the roasted orange and lemon juice into a bowl and add the same amount of extra virgin olive oil and a little swig of red wine vinegar. Season, and pour this dressing over the carrots and avocados. Mix together, have a taste and correct the seasoning. Call your gang round the table while you toast or griddle your ciabatta slices.', 'Tear the toasted bread into little pieces and add to the dressed carrot and avocado.

Pour one of the bottles of cider into the bottom of the tray, put into the hot oven for 30 minutes so the crackling gets going, then turn the heat down to 130°C/250°F/gas ½.', 'After the pork has been in for an hour, add the rest of the cider and cook for a further 6 to 7 hours, or until the meat pulls apart easily. Halfway through the cooking time cover with a double layer of tin foil.', 'Once the pork is perfectly cooked, move it to a large serving board or platter. Carefully pour any fat from the roasting tray into a Kilner jar for some lucky roast potato some day, but leave the wonderful flavourful cooking juices in the pan. Then add the Scotch bonnets to a liquidizer with the spring onions, spices, the juice from the limes, ginger, bay leaves, garlic, a squeeze of honey and 2 lugs of extra virgin olive oil. Pulse together until you get a salsa consistency, then mix the salsa into the juices in the roasting tray, have a taste and balance out the salt and acid if needed. It should have attitude and loads of personality. Pour that salsa on to a platter, then pull the crispy crackling off the shoulder, get rid of any flobbery fat underneath, and use two forks to roughly pull the meat apart. Pile the meat on top of the salsa and toss together quickly.', 'Tear over any coriander leaves and snap those wonderful zigzags of crackling on top of the meat and serve with good quality apple sauce.

Add a small lug of olive oil to get the flavour going and add 1 pinch of sea salt for each bird. Mix well. Rub this marinade onto your poussins. Pop them in sandwich bags and put them in the fridge to marinate for at least 1 hour. You can leave them in there overnight if you want to.', 'Remove your birds from the fridge 1 hour before cooking, but keep them out of the sun. When ready to cook, drop the poussins onto the hottest part of your barbie. Give them a couple of minutes on each side and make sure you move them any time that flames come up - you want them to be golden, not black! Once you’ve got a nice colour, move them to the cooler part of your barbie to finish cooking – they’ll need about 20 minutes. You can tell they’re cooked through when you can easily pull the thigh meat away from the bone.', 'Stir the juice and zest of your remaining lime and the finely chopped mint through the yoghurt. Serve the poussins with a good dollop of minty yoghurt, sprinkled with the chilli and baby mint leaves. Delicious.']"

It’s a great thing to serve at a party because when you’ve grilled it on all sides for 15 minutes you can just pop it into a hot oven for an hour quite happily and leave it – and you can serve it as a hot roast or have it cold. My boss at the River Café, Rose Gray, used to baste her grilled pork with herb vinegar and bay leaves, which was a tremendous combination, so feel free to do this, or to use rosemary instead of bay. The way we flavoured ours in Italy was with fennel seeds, dried chilli, salt and pepper. I’m going to give you the recipe for 12, but feel free to halve it, or even double it. It’s dead simple, and it’s made even easier if you ask your butcher to prepare the meat for you. Just ask for a 2kg/4½lb loin of pork, off the bone with the skin removed.', 'First of all, smash your fennel seeds up in a pestle and mortar and crumble and bash in your dried chilli – now this is supposed to give a subtle heat, so I’m going to leave it up to you to use as much or as little as you prefer. Put your loin of pork on to a chopping board and score the fat in a criss-cross fashion. Rub the meat all over with a little olive oil, then sprinkle the fennel seeds and chilli all over the pork. Cover the pork up and put it to one side in a roasting tray – if it has come straight out of the fridge let it come to room temperature – so that it can absorb the flavours.', 'About an hour before you’re ready to cook, you need to light your barbecue to let it get to the right temperature. I’d advise you to use charcoal instead of gas so that you get a lovely chargrilled flavour coming through. You can also, of course, roast the meat in the oven, but I prefer to do it on the barbecue. (If you roast it in the oven for the whole time it’ll need 1 hour 20 minutes.) Either way, season the meat quite generously with salt and pepper and place it fat-side down on the grill. This will make the barbecue flame a bit so you’ll probably need to turn it over quickly on to the meat side, but it does tend to get the bars oiled up and the smoke going, which we like. Grill the meat for 10 to 15 minutes, depending on how hot your barbecue is, and remember to keep turning it so it gets those lovely charred bar marks all over it.', 'Remove the pork to the same roasting tray you marinated it in and put it into the oven at 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. After half an hour add the vinegar and rosemary leaves, carefully move the meat around and baste it, and put it back into the oven for another 20 minutes. Remove it from the oven, leave it to rest for 10 minutes, then slice the meat up. All the lovely juices from the tray can be kept warm and poured over the meat just before serving. If you’ve been to Italy, you may have noticed that you really do just get some slices of meat with a simple side dish. At the end of the day, the meat tastes great; so serve it in any way you see fit.']"

After another 10 minutes put the saddle and ribs on. Make sure you turn the meat over every so often. Look after it by controlling the temperature and basting it continuously with the marinade.

Cut the liver into 4 pieces and push one piece on to each remaining skewer, followed by a kidney and more liver.', 'When all the pieces of meat are beautifully cooked, add your skewered bits of kidney and liver on to the barbecue and cook until golden, along with your 2 remaining slices of pancetta. After a few minutes, when the pancetta is browned, put it on top of the meat at the cooler end of the barbie.

You don't always need to, but I sometimes turn the heat up to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6 for a short while until it's really crispy."", 'While this beautiful bird is cooking, you can make your plum sauce. Chuck 10 or 12 destoned plums into a pan with 5 tablespoons of sugar, a couple of pinches of five-spice, a couple of tablespoons of soy sauce, half a teaspoon of chilli powder and a splash of water. Bring to the boil, then simmer until you get a nice shiny pulp. You can remove the plum skins if you want to, but I usually leave them in. Sometimes I add a little grated orange zest, as this goes well with duck. Put the sauce to one side to cool before serving it, and taste to check the seasoning.', ""As for the spring onions and cucumber, that's straightforward. Use half a cucumber and a bunch of spring onions and finely slice them. I strongly advise buying a couple of packs of pre-made pancakes which you can place in a steamer or microwave and slowly steam until nice and hot. The bamboo steamers are only a few quid from Chinese supermarkets, so it's worth getting hold of some and they're great to serve at the table."", 'Once the duck has cooled a little bit, use two forks to shred all the meat off the carcass. I remember the Chinese lady at the restaurant in Sawbridgeworth doing this. You can do the same, putting all the meat with its crispy skin on to a serving plate. Take a pancake, place some duck, a bit of spring onion, a little cucumber and a dollop of plum sauce on to it, then roll it up – lovely.']"

Here's a nice little combination – it's all cooked in the same pot and gives you a lovely broth.

Pat the salmon steaks with a little olive oil, season and place skin-side down in the frying pan. Leave them for 2 minutes to get really crispy then check how they're doing. They'll want around 4 minutes on the skin side and 1 minute on the other. You'll get an idea of how they're cooking as you'll see the salmon change colour."", ""When the fennel has had 4 minutes, add the green beans and the broad beans. Give them a further 2 minutes. By this time you will probably want to turn over the salmon steaks for their last minute. Add the peas to the other veg and cook for a final 2 minutes. Don't be tempted to overcook the salmon – remove it from the heat. Divide the vegetables between 4 bowls, rip over the mint and basil, ladle over some of your hot cooking stock and place the salmon on top. Serve with a dollop of aïoli. Fantastic!""]"

She told me that people in this part of America are really into their pasties! Turns out that in the 1920s and 30s, miners from Cornwall came over to work in Montana and it wasn’t long before the locals developed a taste for the good old Cornish pasty. Their recipes haven’t evolved radically since, but they do embrace local ingredients like chicken, squash and sage. Pastry isn’t exactly health food, but a delicious pasty once in a while won’t hurt you. If you like, you can make a slightly ‘skinnier’ pasty by reducing the butter to 200g and adding 50ml of olive oil. But frankly, if I’m making these I just go for it old-school style.', 'Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Bring your butter and water to the boil in a large pan, then take the pan off the heat. Stir the flour and 1 tablespoon of sea salt into the mixture bit by bit with a spatula, until you’ve got a dough. Tip it on to a floured surface and use your hands to shape it into a smooth ball. Put the ball of dough into a floured bowl, dust the top with flour, then cover with cling film and chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes while you make the filling.', 'Meanwhile, get a large pan and fry your chopped onion in a lug of olive oil for 10 minutes or until softened. Add the diced chicken and fry for 5 minutes until brown, then add the rest of the chopped vegetables and herbs. Fry for another 5 minutes, then add 3 or 4 good gratings of nutmeg. Season well with salt and black pepper, then pour in the chicken stock and Worcestershire sauce. Stir in the flour and simmer on a medium heat for 15 to 20 minutes, until most of the stock has cooked away and you’re left with nice thick gravy.', 'Dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with flour, then divide your pastry dough in half and roll each half out until it’s slightly thinner than 0.5cm. Use a cereal bowl (about 15cm in diameter) to cut 4 circles out of each half, so you end up with 8 circles. You may need to cut out 2 or 3 circles from each half first, then re-roll the remaining pastry to make the rest. Dust the circles with flour, and spoon your filling into the middle of each one. Brush the edges of the pastry with some of the beaten egg, then fold each circle in half over the filling and crimp the edges with your finger and thumb to seal them. If you want to see how this is done, check out this video on how to assemble a pasty.', 'Line 2 baking trays with greaseproof paper, scatter a handful of cornmeal or polenta over the paper, and place your pasties on top. Brush the pasties all over with more of the beaten egg and sprinkle over a little more cornmeal. Bake in the hot oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden, and serve straight away with a fresh green salad. A taste of Cornwall in the Wild West – who’d have thought it!']"

Make a well in the centre and crack the eggs into it. Beat the eggs with a fork until smooth.', 'Using the tips of your fingers, mix the eggs with the flour, incorporating a little at a time, until everything is combined.', 'Knead the pieces of dough together – with a bit of work and some love and attention they’ll all bind together to give you one big, smooth lump of dough!', 'Once you’ve made your dough you need to knead and work it with your hands to develop the gluten in the flour, otherwise your pasta will be flabby and soft when you cook it, instead of springy and al dente. There’s no secret to kneading. You just have to bash the dough about a bit with your hands, squashing it into the table, reshaping it, pulling it, stretching it, squashing it again. It’s quite hard work, and after a few minutes it’s easy to see why the average Italian grandmother has arms like Frank Bruno! You’ll know when to stop – it’s when your pasta starts to feel smooth and silky instead of rough and floury.', 'Wrap the dough in clingfilm and put it in the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes – make sure the clingfilm covers it well or it will dry out and go crusty round the edges (this will give you crusty lumps through your pasta when you roll it out, and nobody likes crusty lumps!).', ""How to roll your pasta: first of all, if you haven't got a pasta machine it's not the end of the world! All the mammas I met while travelling round Italy rolled pasta with their trusty rolling pins and they wouldn't even consider having a pasta machine in the house! When it comes to rolling, the main problem you'll have is getting the pasta thin enough to work with. It's quite difficult to get a big lump of dough rolled out in one piece, and you need a very long rolling pin to do the job properly. The way around this is to roll lots of small pieces of pasta rather than a few big ones. You'll be rolling your pasta into a more circular shape than the long rectangular shapes you'll get from a machine, but use your head and you'll be all right!"", ""If using a machine to roll your pasta, make sure it's clamped firmly to a clean work surface before you start (use the longest available work surface you have). If your surface is cluttered with bits of paper, the kettle, the bread bin, the kids' homework and stuff like that, shift all this out of the way for the time being. It won't take a minute, and starting with a clear space to work in will make things much easier, I promise."", 'Dust your work surface with some Tipo 00 flour, take a lump of pasta dough the size of a large orange and press it out flat with your fingertips. Set the pasta machine at its widest setting - and roll the lump of pasta dough through it. Lightly dust the pasta with flour if it sticks at all.', ""Click the machine down a setting and roll the pasta dough through again. Fold the pasta in half, click the pasta machine back up to the widest setting and roll the dough through again. Repeat this process five or six times. It might seem like you're getting nowhere, but in fact you're working the dough, and once you've folded it and fed it through the rollers a few times, you'll feel the difference. It'll be smooth as silk and this means you're making wicked pasta!"", ""Now it's time to roll the dough out properly, working it through all the settings on the machine, from the widest down to around the narrowest. Lightly dust both sides of the pasta with a little flour every time you run it through."", ""When you've got down to the narrowest setting, to give yourself a tidy sheet of pasta, fold the pasta in half lengthways, then in half again, then in half again once more until you've got a square-ish piece of dough. Turn it 90 degrees and feed it through the machine at the widest setting. As you roll it down through the settings for the last time, you should end up with a lovely rectangular silky sheet of dough with straight sides - just like a real pro! If your dough is a little cracked at the edges, fold it in half just once, click the machine back two settings and feed it through again. That should sort things out."", ""Whether you're rolling by hand or by machine you'll need to know when to stop. If you're making pasta like tagliatelle, lasagne or stracchi you'll need to roll the pasta down to between the thickness of a beer mat and a playing card; if you're making a stuffed pasta like ravioli or tortellini, you'll need to roll it down slightly thinner or to the point where you can clearly see your hand or lines of newsprint through it."", ""Once you've rolled your pasta the way you want it, you need to shape or cut it straight away. Pasta dries much quicker than you think, so whatever recipe you're doing, don't leave it more than a minute or two before cutting or shaping it. You can lay over a damp clean tea towel which will stop it from drying.""]"
